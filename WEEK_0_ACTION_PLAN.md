# Week 0 Action Plan: Framework Deployment Kickoff

**Date:** November 3-10, 2024
**Objective:** Execute initial position and set up tracking infrastructure

---

## Today (Sunday, November 3) - 2 Hours

### ✅ Task 1: Review Framework Score (DONE)
- Current score: **5/12**
- Recommended position: **30% BTC, 0% alts, 70% stables**
- Reasoning: Macro supportive but Bitcoin extended, mixed signals

### ✅ Task 2: Make Initial Position Decision (1 hour)

**Your Current Portfolio:** $[Your actual amount]

**Framework Recommendation:**
- Bitcoin: 30%
- Altcoins: 0% (prerequisites not met)
- Stablecoins: 70%

**Calculate Your Position:**
```
Total Portfolio: $_________
Bitcoin (30%): $_________
Stablecoins (70%): $_________

At BTC price $69,500:
Bitcoin amount: _________ BTC
```

**Decision Points:**

**Option A: Follow Framework Exactly (Recommended)**
- Buy Bitcoin for 30% of portfolio
- Keep 70% in stables (USDC, USDT, or cash)
- Execute: Monday or Tuesday

**Option B: Conservative Adjustment (0.8x multiplier)**
- Buy Bitcoin for 24% of portfolio (30% × 0.8)
- Keep 76% in stables
- Rationale: More conservative given uncertainty

**Option C: Aggressive Adjustment (1.2x multiplier)**
- Buy Bitcoin for 36% of portfolio (30% × 1.2)
- Keep 64% in stables
- Rationale: Willing to take more risk

**Your Choice:** [ ] A  [ ] B  [ ] C

## Quick Decisions Guide

**Question: Should I buy Bitcoin at $69.5k or wait?**

Answer: Framework says 30% position NOW. Score is 5/12 (cautious mode). If you're nervous about the price:
- Option 1: Buy 15% now, 15% on any dip to $67k
- Option 2: Buy 20% now, 10% on dip or breakout
- Option 3: Buy all 30% now (trust the framework)

**Question: What if Bitcoin crashes 10% this week to $62k?**

Answer:
1. Sunday: Rescore framework
2. If score drops to 3-4/12 (likely): Reduce to 15-20%
3. Framework would have you sell at $62k-65k area
4. This is WHY we track weekly - to catch deterioration early

**Question: What if Bitcoin rallies 10% this week to $76k?**

Answer:
1. Sunday: Rescore framework
2. If score improves to 6-7/12: Consider adding to 40-50%
3. If score stays 5/12: HOLD, don't chase (price extended without score improvement)
4. Framework prevents FOMO by requiring score improvement to add

**Question: Should I buy altcoins?**

Answer: NO. Prerequisites not met:
- Bitcoin score: 2.13/4 (need ≥3/4)
- Combined score: 4.93/8 (need ≥6/8)
- Wait for framework to green-light altcoins

**Question: What if I disagree with the framework?**

Answer:
1. This is a TEST - try to follow it strictly for 8 weeks
2. Log your disagreement and reasoning
3. After 8 weeks, compare framework results to your intuition
4. If your intuition was right 7/8 times, maybe you don't need the framework
5. If framework was right 7/8 times, maybe you need to trust it more

## Mental Preparation

**This week, focus on:**
1. ✓ Execution discipline (buy the 30%, don't second-guess)
2. ✓ Infrastructure setup (boring but critical)
3. ✓ Building the habit (Sunday scoring routine)

**This week, avoid:**
1. ✗ Checking price constantly (once per day max)
2. ✗ FOMO on altcoins (prerequisites not met)
3. ✗ Overriding the framework (it's a test, follow strictly)

**Remember:**
- This is a PROOF OF CONCEPT
- 8 weeks is enough to validate or invalidate
- The goal is to LEARN, not to get rich in 8 weeks
- Process > Outcome (for now)

**Let's begin. Execute Week 0 by Friday, score on Sunday, adjust as framework dictates.**

**Week 0 Status: [ ] In Progress → [ ] Complete**

**Ready for Week 1: [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Needs more time**
