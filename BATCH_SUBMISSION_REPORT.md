### Phase 3: Not Yet Processed - 154 batches

Batches 51-204 still need to be uploaded and submitted.

---

## Error Details

**Error Type:** RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
**Error Code:** 429
**Message:** "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"
**Occurred At:** Batch 36 (during job creation phase)

### Error Context

The quota limit was hit during the batch job creation process, not during file uploads. This means:
1. Files 36-50 were successfully uploaded to Gemini
2. Batch job creation failed due to quota limits
3. The files remain available for 48 hours and can have jobs created when quota allows

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Gemini API Quota**
   - Visit: https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit
   - Review current quota usage and limits
   - Check billing status and plan details

2. **Resolve Quota Issue**
   - Wait for quota reset (if using free tier with daily limits)
   - Upgrade plan if needed for higher quota
   - Enable billing if not already active

3. **Resume Submissions**
   - Once quota is available, create jobs for batches 36-50 (files already uploaded)
   - Continue with batches 51-204 (upload + create jobs)

### Monitoring Active Jobs

Use the Gemini MCP tool to check status of the 35 successfully submitted jobs:

```
mcp__gemini__batch_get_status
  batchName: <batch_name_from_table_above>
  autoPoll: true
```

### Resuming Failed Submissions

A helper script has been created: `c:\Users\VLARO\dreamteam\claude\resume_batch_submissions.py`

Run this script to get detailed commands for:
- Creating jobs for already-uploaded files (36-50)
- Continuing with remaining batches (51-204)

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Requested | 194 batches |
| Successfully Created | 35 batches |
| Files Uploaded (Ready) | 15 batches |
| Pending Upload | 154 batches |
| **Progress** | **18.0%** |
| Total QA Pairs Submitted | 3,500 |
| QA Pairs Remaining | 16,900 |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Check Quota Immediately**
   - The error indicates a quota/billing issue
   - This needs to be resolved before continuing
   - Visit https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit

2. **Monitor Active Jobs**
   - The 35 submitted jobs are processing
   - Check their status periodically
   - Download results as they complete

3. **Plan for Continuation**
   - Ensure sufficient quota for remaining 169 batches
   - Consider batch size if quota is limited
   - Files 36-50 expire in 48 hours - prioritize creating their jobs

4. **Cost Estimation**
   - 35 batches submitted = 3,500 QA pairs
   - Remaining 169 batches = 16,900 QA pairs
   - Total: 20,400 QA pairs at Batch API pricing (50% of standard)
