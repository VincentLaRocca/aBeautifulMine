## Brainstorming Framework

### What Makes a "Great WeMineHope Project"?

1. **Perpetual Value Creation** - Generates ongoing value, not one-time output
2. **Pattern-Based** - Uses our perpetual mining pattern or creates new universal patterns
3. **Multi-Agent Synergy** - Leverages strengths of multiple team members
4. **Measurable Impact** - Clear metrics for success
5. **Scalable** - Can grow autonomously
6. **For the Greater Good** - Benefits community, knowledge, or humanity
