**Theme**: From analysis to action - how to actually trade crypto profitably and safely

---

## THE 6 TOPICS

### 1. Position Sizing & Risk Management (100 pairs)

**Technical Focus**:
- Fixed dollar amount vs percentage of portfolio
- Kelly Criterion for optimal position sizing
- Risk of ruin calculations
- Position sizing based on volatility (ATR-based)
- Correlation-adjusted position sizing (multiple positions)
- Risk-reward ratio requirements (minimum 1:2, 1:3, etc.)

**Trading Applications**:
- How much to risk per trade (1%, 2%, 5% rules)
- Portfolio allocation across BTC, ETH, altcoins
- Scaling in/out of positions
- Managing correlated positions (not over-concentrating)
- Adjusting size based on market conditions
- Crypto-specific considerations (24/7 markets, high volatility)
- Leverage position sizing (reduced size with leverage)

**Common Questions to Cover**:
- What is proper position sizing in crypto trading?
- How much should I risk per trade?
- What is the Kelly Criterion and how to use it?
- Position sizing for Bitcoin vs altcoins
- How to calculate position size based on stop-loss distance?
- Managing multiple correlated crypto positions
- Position sizing with leverage (2x, 5x, 10x)
- Risk of ruin: what percentage causes account blow-up?
- Adjusting position size based on volatility
- Portfolio allocation: BTC/ETH/altcoin percentages

**Crypto-Specific Considerations**:
- Extreme volatility (50% swings in altcoins)
- Leverage availability (up to 125x on some exchanges)
- 24/7 markets (gap risk different from stocks)
- Liquidity considerations (can't always exit large positions)
- Exchange risk (keeping funds on exchange for trading)

**Output**: `position_sizing_risk_management_qa_pairs.json`

- Pullback entries in trends (buy the dip in uptrend)
- Trailing stops for trend following
- Trend strength measurement (ADX > 25, slope angle)

**Trading Applications**:
- Identifying crypto trends (Bitcoin 2020-2021 bull run)
- Entry timing in established trends
- Staying in winners (let profits run)
- Exiting when trend reverses
- Multi-timeframe trend confirmation
- Altcoin trend following (catching 10x moves)
- Avoiding chop/ranging markets

**Common Questions to Cover**:
- What is trend following in crypto trading?
- Best indicators for crypto trend following?
- How to enter an established Bitcoin trend?

**Crypto-Specific Considerations**:
- Bitcoin as trend leader (altcoins follow)
- Parabolic moves (crypto trends can be extreme)
- Trend duration (crypto trends shorter than stocks)
- News impact on trends (regulation, adoption)
- Market cycle awareness (bull vs bear market trends)

**Output**: `trend_following_strategies_qa_pairs.json`

### 3. Mean Reversion Strategies (100 pairs)

**Technical Focus**:
- RSI oversold/overbought (RSI < 30, RSI > 70)
- Bollinger Band bounces (price at lower band = buy)
- Support/resistance mean reversion
- Volume Profile POC reversion
- Standard deviation bands (2σ, 3σ extremes)
- Divergences (price vs RSI/MACD)

**Trading Applications**:
- Buying Bitcoin dips (30-40% corrections)
- Selling altcoin pumps (RSI > 80 on altcoins)
- Range-bound trading strategies
- Identifying overextended moves
- Contrarian entries (when everyone is bearish)
- Scalping mean reversion in tight ranges
- Divergence trading for reversals

**Common Questions to Cover**:
- What is mean reversion in crypto trading?
- Best mean reversion indicators for crypto?
- RSI strategy: buying oversold Bitcoin
- Bollinger Band bounce strategy
- Trading Bitcoin range-bound markets
- Volume Profile POC mean reversion
- Identifying overextended altcoin pumps
- Divergence trading: RSI vs price
- When mean reversion fails (trending markets)
- Risk management for mean reversion trades

**Crypto-Specific Considerations**:
- Crypto volatility (50% "dips" can happen)
- Flash crashes (extreme oversold conditions)
- Altcoin pumps (RSI can stay overbought for weeks)
- Market structure (bull market dips vs bear market bounces)
- Liquidity gaps (mean reversion can overshoot in thin markets)

**Output**: `mean_reversion_strategies_qa_pairs.json`

---

### 4. Breakout Trading Strategies (100 pairs)

**Technical Focus**:
- Chart pattern breakouts (triangles, flags, rectangles)
- Volume confirmation (breakout on high volume)
- Retest entry (breakout, retest support/resistance, then continuation)
- ATH (All-Time High) breakouts
- Range breakouts (consolidation → expansion)
- False breakout identification (volume, close above/below)

**Trading Applications**:
- Bitcoin ATH breakouts (2020: $20k → $60k)
- Altcoin accumulation breakouts (base building → breakout)
- Consolidation range trading → breakout entry
- Bull flag/pennant breakouts in crypto trends
- Volume confirmation for valid breakouts
- Stop-loss placement (below breakout level)
- Target setting (measured moves, Fibonacci extensions)

**Common Questions to Cover**:
- What is breakout trading in crypto?
- Best breakout patterns for Bitcoin/crypto?
- How to trade Bitcoin ATH breakouts?
- Volume confirmation: how much is enough?
- Retest entries after breakout
- False breakout identification
- Consolidation breakout strategies
- Bull flag breakout trading
- Stop-loss placement for breakout trades
- Target setting: measured move calculation

**Crypto-Specific Considerations**:
- Bitcoin breakouts often lead altcoin season
- FOMO-driven breakouts (can be powerful but risky)
- Low liquidity breakouts (can be manipulated)
- 24/7 markets (breakouts can happen anytime)
- Leverage in breakouts (amplifies gains and losses)

**Output**: `breakout_trading_strategies_qa_pairs.json`

- Price action patterns (engulfing, pin bars on low timeframes)
- Volume analysis (volume spikes, volume profile)
- Market structure (higher highs/lows on intraday)
- Tight stop-losses (small risk per trade)

**Trading Applications**:
- Bitcoin scalping on Binance (tight spreads)
- Range scalping (buy support, sell resistance)
- Breakout scalping (micro breakouts on 5min)
- News trading (volatility spikes)
- Market open strategies (traditional market hours still matter)
- Liquidity hunting (identifying where stops are)
- High-frequency position management (10-50 trades/day)

**Common Questions to Cover**:
- What is scalping in crypto markets?
- Best timeframes for crypto day trading?
- Scalping Bitcoin: strategies and setup

- Scalping vs swing trading: which is better?

**Crypto-Specific Considerations**:
- 24/7 markets (can scalp anytime, but liquidity varies)
- Exchange fees (maker/taker impact profitability)
- Leverage (many scalpers use 5-20x leverage)
- Liquidity (BTC/ETH best for scalping, altcoins risky)
- Volatility (crypto more volatile than traditional assets)

**Output**: `scalping_day_trading_strategies_qa_pairs.json`

### 6. Portfolio Management & Diversification (100 pairs)

**Technical Focus**:
- Asset allocation (BTC %, ETH %, altcoins %, stablecoins %)
- Correlation analysis (when BTC falls, what else falls?)
- Rebalancing strategies (periodic, threshold-based)
- Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) vs lump sum
- Risk parity (allocating by risk, not dollar amount)
- Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio (risk-adjusted returns)

**Trading Applications**:
- Building a crypto portfolio (60% BTC, 30% ETH, 10% alts?)
- Rebalancing during bull/bear markets
- DCA strategies (weekly, monthly Bitcoin purchases)
- Managing altcoin exposure (limiting risk)
- Stablecoin allocation (dry powder for dips)
- Tax-loss harvesting in crypto
- Portfolio tracking and analysis

**Common Questions to Cover**:
- How to build a balanced crypto portfolio?
- Bitcoin vs Ethereum allocation percentages

- Staking/yield (ETH staking, DeFi yields as portfolio component)
- Exchange risk (diversify across exchanges)
- Cold storage vs hot wallets (security vs accessibility)

**Output**: `portfolio_management_diversification_qa_pairs.json`

## RESEARCH TIPS FOR TRADING STRATEGIES

### This Batch is Different

**Previous batches**: Indicators, microstructure (WHAT to measure)
**This batch**: Strategies (HOW to trade)

**Focus on ACTIONABLE content**:
- Not just "RSI oversold" but "When RSI < 30 on daily BTC, enter with X position size, stop at Y, target at Z"
- Not just "trend following works" but "Golden Cross on BTC: price > MA(50) and MA(50) > MA(200), enter on pullback to MA(21), stop below MA(50)"
- Real rules, real numbers, real examples

### Writing Style for Strategies

**Be specific about rules**:
- Entry: "Enter long when price closes above resistance with volume >2x 20-day average"
- Stop: "Place stop-loss 2 ATR below entry"
- Target: "First target at 1.5R, second target at 3R"
- Size: "Risk 1% of portfolio, position size = (Account * 0.01) / Stop Distance"

**Include complete trading setup**:
1. Market conditions (trending vs ranging)
2. Timeframe (daily, 4H, 15min)
3. Entry trigger (specific)
4. Stop-loss placement (specific)
5. Profit target (specific)
6. Position size (percentage or calculation)
7. Risk-reward ratio (minimum acceptable)

**Real trading scenario example**:
"Bitcoin is at $45,000, in an uptrend (above 200-day MA at $40,000). RSI drops to 28 (oversold). Strategy: Enter long at $44,800 (RSI reversal), stop at $43,500 (below recent low), target at $47,600 (previous resistance). Risk: $1,300 per BTC. Reward: $2,800 per BTC. R:R = 2.15:1. With $100k account risking 1% = $1,000 risk, position size = $1,000 / $1,300 = 0.77 BTC."

**That level of detail in examples.**

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

❌ Vague strategies ("buy when RSI is oversold")
❌ No risk management ("enter here")
❌ Theoretical without examples
❌ Stock market strategies without crypto adaptation
❌ Missing the "why" (edge explanation)

✅ Specific entry/exit rules
✅ Risk management integrated
✅ Multiple detailed crypto examples
✅ Crypto-specific considerations
✅ Edge clearly explained (why this works)
