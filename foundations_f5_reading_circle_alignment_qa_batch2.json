    "question": "How do you establish a weekly scoring routine to track framework changes over time and trigger position adjustments?",
    "answer": "Consistent weekly scoring is the difference between using the framework reactively (\"let me check the score after Bitcoin moved 20%\") versus proactively (\"the score dropped from 8 to 6, I'm reducing exposure BEFORE the crash\"). Here's the complete system for weekly tracking and automated decision triggers:\n\n**THE WEEKLY SCORING ROUTINE:**\n\n**WHEN: Every Sunday, 9-11 AM**\n\nWhy Sunday? Markets are closed (stocks), crypto is typically lower volume (weekend), you have mental clarity without the noise of active trading. This becomes your weekly \"market check-in.\"\n\n**TIME REQUIRED: 30-45 minutes**\n\nBreakdown:\n- 15 minutes: Gather all data (macro, on-chain, prices)\n- 15 minutes: Score all 12 points\n- 10 minutes: Compare to last week, identify changes\n- 5 minutes: Determine actions for the coming week\n\n---\n\n**STEP 1: DATA GATHERING (15 minutes)**\n\n**Macro Data Collection:**\n\nOpen your browser with these tabs:\n\n**Tab 1: Federal Reserve**\n- Site: fred.stlouisfed.org\n- Check: \n  - Fed Funds Rate (current level)\n  - Fed Balance Sheet (WALCL series - is it growing or shrinking?)\n  - Last FOMC statement (read for rhetoric)\n- Time: 3 minutes\n\n**Tab 2: Money Supply**\n- Site: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL\n- Check:\n  - M2 current level\n  - M2 YoY growth rate (% change from year ago)\n  - 3-month trend (improving, stable, deteriorating?)\n- Site: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD\n- Check: Reverse Repo balance (is it draining?)\n- Time: 3 minutes\n\n**Tab 3: Dollar & Yields**\n- Site: tradingview.com\n- Tickers:\n  - DXY (Dollar Index) - note current level + 3-month % change\n  - US10Y (10-year yield) - note current level\n  - DFII10 (10-year TIPS, real yield) - note current level\n- Time: 2 minutes\n\n**Tab 4: Risk Appetite**\n- Site: tradingview.com\n- Tickers:\n  - SPX (S&P 500) - note level + trend\n  - IXIC (Nasdaq) - note level + trend\n  - VIX (volatility index) - note current level\n- Site: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2\n- Check: High Yield OAS (credit spreads) - note current level\n- Time: 3 minutes\n\n**Bitcoin Data Collection:**\n\n**Tab 5: Cycle Position**\n- Calculator: Days since last halving\n  - Last halving: April 19, 2024\n  - Today's date: [Check calendar]\n  - Months post-halving: [Calculate]\n- Time: 1 minute\n\n**Tab 6: On-Chain Metrics**\n- Site: cryptoquant.com OR glassnode.com\n- Check:\n  - Exchange Reserves (total BTC on exchanges)\n  - Exchange Netflow (7-day average, positive or negative?)\n  - LTH Supply (% of supply held >155 days)\n  - SOPR (spent output profit ratio)\n  - Realized Price vs Market Price\n- Time: 5 minutes\n\n**Tab 7: Valuation Metrics**\n- Site: lookintobitcoin.com\n- Check:\n  - MVRV Z-Score (current reading)\n  - 200-Week Moving Average (current level + price premium %)\n  - Pi Cycle Top (is it close to triggering?)\n  - Puell Multiple (current reading)\n- Time: 3 minutes\n\n**Tab 8: Institutional Flows**\n- Site: farside.co.uk (for ETF flows)\n- Check:\n  - Total Bitcoin ETF net flows (past week)\n  - IBIT (BlackRock) flows\n  - FBTC (Fidelity) flows\n- Site: buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/\n- Check: Recent corporate treasury activity (MicroStrategy, etc.)\n- Time: 3 minutes\n\n**Altcoin Data Collection (Only if Macro + Bitcoin ≥ 6/8):**\n\n**Tab 9: Capital Rotation**\n- Site: tradingview.com\n- Ticker: BTC.D (Bitcoin Dominance)\n- Check: Current level + 3-month % change\n- Ticker: ETHBTC (Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio)\n- Check: Trend (rising or falling?)\n- Time: 2 minutes\n\n**Tab 10: Sector Performance**\n- Site: coinmarketcap.com OR coingecko.com\n- Check: Sector views (AI, DeFi, L2, Gaming, etc.)\n- Note: Top performing sector (past 7 days, past 30 days)\n- Time: 3 minutes\n\n**Tab 11: Stablecoin Supply**\n- Site: defillama.com\n- Check: Total stablecoin market cap\n- Note: 3-month % change (growing or shrinking?)\n- Time: 2 minutes\n\n---\n\n**STEP 2: SCORING (15 minutes)**\n\nUse the 12-point checklist from F5-001.

Target 0-5% position. Sit in stables.\n→ NO: Continue...\n\n**Current Score 3-4/12?**\n→ YES: Defensive mode. Target 5-20% position (Bitcoin only). Altcoins OFF.\n→ NO: Continue...\n\n**Current Score 5-6/12?**\n→ YES: Cautious mode. Target 20-40% position (mostly Bitcoin). Monitor for improvement to 7+.\n→ NO: Continue...\n\n**Current Score 7-8/12?**\n→ YES: Building mode. Target 40-60% position. \n  - If macro + Bitcoin ≥ 6/8: Allow 20-30% altcoin exposure.\n  - If not: Bitcoin only.\n→ NO: Continue...\n\n**Current Score 9-10/12?**\n→ YES: Aggressive mode. Target 60-80% position.\n  - Macro + Bitcoin ≥ 6/8: 40-50% altcoins (sector leaders).\n→ NO: Continue...\n\n**Current Score 11-12/12?**\n→ YES: Maximum mode. Target 80-100% position.\n  - Allocate across Bitcoin (40%), alts (50%), keep 10% dry powder.\n  - This is RARE (1-2 times per cycle). When it happens, GO BIG.\n\n---\n\n**AUTOMATED TRIGGERS (Set Alerts):**\n\n**Create Google Sheets formulas or alerts for:**\n\n**Trigger 1: Outer Circle Veto**\n- Formula: `IF(Macro < 2, \"EXIT CRYPTO\", \"OK\")`\n- Alert: If macro drops below 2/4, get email/SMS alert\n- Action: Exit to stables immediately, don't wait\n\n**Trigger 2: Total Score Cliff**\n- Formula: `IF(Total < 3, \"EMERGENCY EXIT\", \"OK\")`\n- Alert: If total score drops below 3/12\n- Action: Emergency exit, something broke\n\n**Trigger 3: Confluence Alert**\n- Formula: `IF(Total >= 10, \"MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY\", \"OK\")`\n- Alert: If total score reaches 10+/12\n- Action: Go maximum aggression, rare opportunity\n\n**Trigger 4: Score Deterioration**\n- Formula: `IF(This_Week - Last_Week < -1.5, \"REDUCE POSITION\", \"OK\")`\n- Alert: If score drops 1.5+ points week-over-week\n- Action: Reduce position by 20-30% within 24 hours\n\n---\n\n**SAMPLE WEEKLY LOG (Track Progress):**\n\n```\n=== WEEK OF NOVEMBER 3, 2024 ===\n\nFRAMEWORK SCORE: 5.0/12 (Last week: 5.2/12, Δ: -0.2)\n\nBREAKDOWN:\n- Macro: 2.9/4 (↓ from 3.1, DXY rose, VIX ticked up)\n- Bitcoin: 2.1/4 (↓ from 2.3, valuation stretched further)\n- Altcoins: N/A (prerequisites not met)\n\nKEY CHANGES:\n- Fed: Unchanged (still 4.75%)\n- M2: Grew 0.2% MoM (positive)\n- Bitcoin: Rallied $75k → $88k (+17%, now extended)\n- MVRV: Approaching 3.0 (overvaluation warning)\n\nACTION THIS WEEK:\n- Score stable-to-slightly-declining (5.2 → 5.0)\n- Position: Maintain 30% (20% BTC, 10% stables)\n- Take profits: Sold 5% BTC at $87k (book profits on extension)\n- Watch for: Score improvement to 6+ (add) or deterioration to 4 (reduce)\n\nNOTES:\n- Bitcoin extended but macro still supportive\n- Not compelling enough for large position\n- Waiting for pullback or framework improvement\n\n=== WEEK OF NOVEMBER 10, 2024 ===\n[Next week's entry...]\n```\n\n---\n\n**DISCIPLINE: The Weekly Non-Negotiables**\n\n**1. Score EVERY Sunday** (even if you \"feel\" like nothing changed)\n- Feelings lie. Data doesn't.\n- You'll catch deterioration 1-2 weeks earlier than traders who score monthly.\n\n**2. Act on triggers within stated timeframes**\n- Major deterioration (-2 points): Same day\n- Moderate deterioration (-1 to -1.9): Within 24 hours\n- Don't wait for \"confirmation\" - the framework IS the confirmation\n\n**3. Keep a written log**\n- Your future self will thank you\n- Patterns emerge over months: \"Every time macro drops below 2, I should exit within 48 hours\"\n- Accountability: Did you follow your own rules?\n\n**4. Review monthly**\n- First Sunday of each month: Review past 4 weeks\n- Did your actions match framework signals?\n- Where did you override the framework? (Hopefully rare)\n- How did those overrides perform? (Probably poorly)\n\n**The weekly routine turns the framework from theory into HABIT. Habits beat willpower. Systems beat motivation.**\n\nScore every week. Act on changes. Compound edge over years.",
