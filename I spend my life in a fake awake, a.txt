I spend my life in a fake awake, a life of walking in my sleep. My days and nights, they blend together. My up seems down. My progress is a treadmill. Production for it s sake. As close as I get to a life of meaning. Meaning for meanings sake. My life's become a puzzle. Missing pieces everywhere. Never meant to fit together. Perfection beyond my reach my soul to take. I've yet to solve the puzzle. I've yet to make a rhyme.
