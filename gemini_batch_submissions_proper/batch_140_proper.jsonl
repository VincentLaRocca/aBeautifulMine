Welles Wilder that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes on a scale of 0-100.\n\n**Formula:** RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))\nWhere RS = Average Gain / Average Loss over a specified period (typically 14)\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- RSI > 70: Overbought territory (potential selling pressure)\n- RSI < 30: Oversold territory (potential buying opportunity)\n- RSI = 50: Neutral momentum\n\n**Crypto-Specific Application (2024-2025):**\nRSI is particularly valuable in crypto markets due to high volatility. During Bitcoin's 2024 rally from $40K to $73K, RSI frequently showed overbought readings (>80) during parabolic moves, warning traders of potential corrections.\n\n**Advanced Uses:**\n1. **Divergence Trading:** When price makes new highs but RSI doesn't, it signals weakening momentum (bearish divergence)\n2. **Support/Resistance:** RSI trendlines often break before price, providing early signals\n3. **Multi-Timeframe Analysis:** Combining daily and 4-hour RSI for confluence\n\n**Common Settings:**\n- Default: 14-period\n- Day trading: 9-period for faster signals\n- Swing trading: 21-period for smoother readings\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Can remain overbought/oversold for extended periods in strong trends\n- Less effective in ranging markets\n- Should be combined with volume and price action confirmation\n\n**Example Trade:** In March 2024, when Ethereum showed bullish divergence (price making lower lows, RSI making higher lows), it preceded a 40% rally from $3,200 to $4,500.\"\n\n---\n\n**Instructions:**\nProcess all Q&A pairs in the batch.

This is particularly relevant when it comes to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which present unique regulatory challenges.\\n\\nCFTC Jurisdiction:\\nThe CFTC has jurisdiction over commodity futures, options, and swaps, including those related to cryptocurrencies. The CFTC has determined that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are commodities, and therefore fall under its regulatory purview. This gives the CFTC authority to oversee the trading of cryptocurrency derivatives, such as futures and options contracts.\\n\\nSEC Jurisdiction:\\nThe SEC has jurisdiction over securities, including investment contracts. The SEC has taken the position that many cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products, such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), can be considered securities and therefore fall under its regulatory authority. The SEC has also asserted jurisdiction over certain DAO structures, arguing that they can be considered investment contracts and therefore securities.\\n\\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):\\nDAOs are blockchain-based organizations that operate without a central authority, using smart contracts to automate decision-making and governance. The decentralized and autonomous nature of DAOs creates challenges in determining regulatory jurisdiction.\\n\\nJurisdiction Challenges with DAOs:\\n- Lack of centralized control: DAOs lack a central authority, making it difficult to determine which regulatory body has jurisdiction.\\n- Borderless nature: DAOs can operate globally, making it challenging to apply a single regulatory framework.\\n- Evolving structures: The structure and functionality of DAOs can vary widely, making it difficult to apply a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach.\\n\\nRegulatory Efforts and Ongoing Debates:\\nThe CFTC and SEC have been actively engaged in discussions and enforcement actions related to the regulation of cryptocurrencies and DAOs. Some key developments include:\\n\\n- The SEC has brought enforcement actions against several DAO-related projects, arguing that they violated securities laws.\\n- The CFTC has taken enforcement actions against individuals and entities involved in the trading of cryptocurrency derivatives without proper registration.\\n- Regulatory agencies have issued guidance and statements to clarify their respective jurisdictions and approaches to cryptocurrencies and DAOs.\\n- Policymakers and industry stakeholders continue to debate the appropriate regulatory framework for these emerging technologies.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CFTC, \\\"Primer on Virtual Currencies\\\" (2017)\\n- SEC, \\\"Framework for 'Investment Contract' Analysis of Digital Assets\\\" (2019)\\n- CFTC v.
