Direct Address Counting:\\n   - The most straightforward approach is to directly count the number of new unique addresses created on the blockchain over a specified time period.\\n   - This can be done by querying the blockchain data and keeping a running count of addresses that have not been seen before.\\n   - Tools like blockchain explorers, APIs, and custom scripts can be used to automate this process.\\n\\n2. Net New Addresses:\\n   - An alternative is to calculate the \\\"net new addresses\\\" created, which accounts for both new address creation and address reuse/closure.\\n   - This involves tracking the total number of active addresses at the start and end of the time period, and calculating the difference.\\n   - The net new addresses would be the increase in total active addresses over that time.\\n\\n3. Clustering and De-Duplicating Addresses:\\n   - To get a more accurate picture, some methodologies involve clustering related addresses and de-duplicating addresses controlled by the same user/entity.\\n   - This helps avoid double-counting addresses that are part of the same wallet or controlled by the same user.\\n   - Advanced address clustering techniques leverage transaction patterns, ownership heuristics, and other on-chain data.\\n\\n4. Adjusting for Exchange Addresses:\\n   - Since exchange wallets can skew the new address creation metric, some analyses adjust the data to exclude known exchange addresses.\\n   - This is done by identifying and removing addresses associated with major cryptocurrency exchanges.\\n\\nInterpreting the New Addresses Created Indicator:\\n- Rapid growth in new addresses created is generally seen as a positive sign of increasing user adoption and network activity.\\n- However, the metric should be analyzed in context, as high new address creation could also indicate speculative activity or churning of addresses.\\n- Comparing the new address creation rate to other metrics like transaction volume, active users, and price movements can provide deeper insights.\\n- Monitoring trends and changes in the new address creation rate over time is more informative than just looking at the raw number.\\n\\nKey Sources:\\n- Blockchain analytics firms like Glassnode, Chainalysis, and Messari\\n- Academic research on cryptocurrency user behavior and network dynamics\\n- Whitepapers and technical documentation from cryptocurrency projects\\n\\nOverall, the New Addresses Created indicator provides a valuable window into the growth and adoption of a cryptocurrency network, but should be interpreted carefully in the broader context of the ecosystem.\",\n    \"topic\": \"New Addresses Created technical indicator cryptocurrency trading\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"pair_id\": \"190_15\",\n    \"question\": \"\\\"New Addresses Created as a leading indicator of cryptocurrency market sentiment\\\"\",\n    \"answer\": \"Here is a comprehensive overview of new addresses created as a leading indicator of cryptocurrency market sentiment:\\n\\nWhat are New Addresses Created?\\n- New addresses created refers to the number of new cryptocurrency wallet addresses that are generated on a blockchain network over a given time period.\\n- This metric provides insight into the level of new user adoption and activity on a cryptocurrency platform.\\n- As more new addresses are created, it typically signals growing interest, usage, and adoption of that cryptocurrency.\\n\\nHow New Addresses Created Can Indicate Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment:\\n- New addresses created is considered a leading indicator of cryptocurrency market sentiment and future price movements.\\n- When the number of new addresses being created is increasing, it suggests growing user interest, new money flowing into the market, and potential for future price appreciation.\\n- Conversely, a decline in new addresses created can signal waning user interest and potentially foreshadow future price declines.\\n- New addresses created is often analyzed alongside other metrics like trading volume, active addresses, and on-chain activity to get a more comprehensive view of market sentiment.\\n\\nExamples and Data:\\n- According to a study by Glassnode, the number of new Bitcoin addresses created per day reached an all-time high of over 750,000 in November 2021, coinciding with Bitcoin's price reaching an all-time high above $68,000.\\n- In contrast, during the 2018 crypto bear market, new Bitcoin address creation declined significantly, dropping from over 400,000 per day to under 100,000 per day.\\n- Similar trends have been observed for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, where new address creation spiked to record highs during the 2021 bull run.\\n- Analysts often track new address creation rates and compare them to past market cycles to identify potential changes in user adoption and sentiment.\\n\\nSources:\\n- Glassnode. \\\"Glassnode Studio.\\\" https://studio.glassnode.com/\\n- CoinDesk. \\\"New Bitcoin Addresses Hit Record High as Crypto Market Surges.\\\" https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/10/new-bitcoin-addresses-hit-record-high-as-crypto-market-surges/\\n- Cointelegraph. \\\"New Ethereum addresses created hit new all-time high in 2021.\\\" https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-ethereum-addresses-created-hit-new-all-time-high-in-2021\",\n    \"topic\": \"New Addresses Created technical indicator cryptocurrency trading\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"pair_id\": \"190_16\",\n    \"question\": \"\\\"Backtesting the performance of New Addresses Created-based trading strategies\\\"\",\n    \"answer\": \"Backtesting the performance of New Addresses Created-based trading strategies:\\n\\nOverview:\\nBacktesting is the process of evaluating a trading strategy or investment model by applying it to historical market data to see how it would have performed. In the context of cryptocurrency markets, one strategy that has been explored is using the metric of \\\"New Addresses Created\\\" as an indicator for potential trading signals.\\n\\nThe rationale behind this strategy is that an increase in the number of new addresses being created on a blockchain network may signal growing user adoption and interest, which could lead to future price appreciation of the associated cryptocurrency. By backtesting trading strategies that incorporate this metric, researchers can assess the historical performance and potential viability of such an approach.\\n\\nKey Considerations:\\n- New Addresses Created: This refers to the number of new unique cryptocurrency wallet addresses that are created on a blockchain network over a given time period.
