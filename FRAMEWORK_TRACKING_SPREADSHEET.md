## Automation Ideas (Optional)

**Google Sheets Formulas:**

**Auto-calculate total score:**
`=SUM(B2:D2)` where B2=Macro, C2=Bitcoin, D2=Altcoin

**Auto-recommend position:**
```
=IF(E2<=2,"0-5%",
  IF(E2<=4,"5-20%",
  IF(E2<=6,"20-40%",
  IF(E2<=8,"40-60%",
  IF(E2<=10,"60-80%","80-100%")))))
```

**Auto-calculate portfolio value:**
`=(BTC_Holdings * Current_BTC_Price) + (ALT_Holdings * Current_ALT_Price) + Stablecoin_Balance`

**Week-over-week change:**
`=E3-E2` where E=Total Score column

**Performance vs baseline:**
`=(Current_Value - $100,000) / $100,000` formatted as percentage
