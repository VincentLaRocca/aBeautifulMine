  "answer_prompt": "Core Task:\n\nYour mission is to create a comprehensive, expert-level answer optimized for training AI agents. This answer will be used to train models to provide high-quality responses to cryptocurrency and trading questions.\n\nCRITICAL: This is for ONE QUESTION ONLY. Answer each question individually with a complete, standalone response of 3,000+ characters.\n\n---\n\n## Quality Standards for AI Training Data\n\n### 1. Accuracy & Factual Correctness\n- Base all information on established, verifiable sources\n- When discussing formulas, calculations, or metrics, provide exact definitions\n- Include specific numbers, percentages, and data points when available\n- Distinguish between established facts and expert opinions\n- If information is uncertain or debated, acknowledge multiple perspectives\n\n### 2. Depth & Comprehensiveness\n- Move beyond surface-level definitions to explain underlying mechanisms\n- Explain the \"why\" behind concepts, not just the \"what\"\n- Cover foundational concepts before advancing to complex applications\n- Include both theoretical understanding and practical implementation\n- Address edge cases, exceptions, and limitations\n\n### 3. Structure for Learning\nStructure your answer to maximize learning value:\n\n**Introduction (200-400 chars)**\n- Clear definition of the core concept\n- Brief context on why it matters\n- Scope of what will be covered\n\n**Main Body (2000-2500 chars)**\n- **Fundamentals**: Core concepts, definitions, basic mechanics\n- **Mechanics**: How it works step-by-step, formulas, calculations\n- **Application**: Real-world usage with crypto-specific examples\n- **Examples**: Concrete scenarios (e.g., \"When analyzing BTC/USD on a 4-hour chart...\")\n- **Nuances**: Edge cases, variations, common misconceptions\n\n**Practical Section (500-800 chars)**\n- Step-by-step implementation guide\n- Best practices and common pitfalls\n- Real trading scenarios with specific examples\n- Integration with other tools/indicators\n\n**Risks & Limitations (300-500 chars)**\n- What can go wrong\n- When this approach fails\n- Limitations and constraints\n- Risk management considerations\n\n**Conclusion (200-300 chars)**\n- Key takeaways\n- When to use this approach\n- Next steps for deeper learning\n\n### 4. Educational Value\n- Write as if teaching a professional trader who wants to understand deeply\n- Use progressive disclosure: simple concepts first, then build complexity\n- Include \"why\" explanations: don't just state facts, explain reasoning\n- Use analogies and comparisons to clarify complex concepts\n- Provide context: how this fits into broader trading strategies\n\n### 5. Crypto-Specific Focus\n- Always use cryptocurrency examples (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)\n- Reference crypto-specific platforms, exchanges, and tools\n- Address crypto market characteristics (24/7 trading, volatility, etc.)\n- Include DeFi, NFT, or blockchain-specific considerations when relevant\n- Use realistic price examples and scenarios\n\n### 6. Actionability\n- Provide concrete steps traders can follow\n- Include specific parameter values, thresholds, or settings\n- Give examples of \"good\" vs \"bad\" implementations\n- Explain decision-making processes\n- Include checklists or decision trees when helpful\n\n### 7. Consistency & Clarity\n- Use consistent terminology throughout\n- Define technical terms on first use\n- Use Markdown formatting for readability:\n  - **Bold** for key concepts\n  - Headings for major sections\n  - Bullet points for lists\n  - Code blocks for formulas or calculations\n- Write in clear, professional prose (avoid overly casual or overly academic)\n\n### 8. Training Data Optimization\n- Ensure the answer is self-contained (can be understood without context)\n- Avoid references to \"previous questions\" or \"as mentioned above\"\n- Include enough context that an AI can learn from this single example\n- Make implicit knowledge explicit (explain assumptions)\n- Include common variations of the concept\n\n---\n\n## Output Requirements\n\n- **Minimum Length**: 3,000 characters (strictly enforced)\n- **Format**: Markdown with clear structure\n- **Tone**: Expert, educational, professional\n- **Style**: Clear, precise, comprehensive\n- **Examples**: Include at least 2-3 concrete crypto trading examples\n\n---\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- ❌ Generic or vague statements without specifics\n- ❌ Overly simplistic explanations (assume professional audience)\n- ❌ Hallucinated facts or unsupported claims\n- ❌ References to other questions or external context\n- ❌ Repetitive content to meet length requirements\n- ❌ Yes/no answers without explanation\n- ❌ Marketing language or promotional content\n\n---\n\n## Example Structure Template\n\n```markdown\n# [Concept Name]: [Brief Definition]\n\n[Introduction paragraph - what is it, why it matters]\n\n## Understanding [Concept]\n\n[Core explanation with mechanics]\n\n## How [Concept] Works\n\n[Step-by-step explanation]\n\n## Practical Application in Crypto Trading\n\n### Example 1: [Specific Scenario]\n[Detailed example with numbers]\n\n### Example 2: [Another Scenario]\n[Another detailed example]\n\n## Best Practices\n\n[Actionable guidance]\n\n## Common Pitfalls and Limitations\n\n[What to watch out for]\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n[Summary points]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your answer, verify:\n- [ ] Meets 3,000+ character minimum\n- [ ] Includes at least 2-3 concrete crypto examples\n- [ ] Explains \"why\" not just \"what\"\n- [ ] Covers fundamentals before advanced topics\n- [ ] Includes practical application section\n- [ ] Addresses risks/limitations\n- [ ] Uses proper Markdown formatting\n- [ ] Self-contained (no external references)\n- [ ] Professional, expert tone throughout\n- [ ] Actionable and specific (not vague)\n\n"
