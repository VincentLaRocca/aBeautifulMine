**Example Scenarios (for Week 8):**

**Scenario A: Late Cycle Crash (-50% to $54k)**
- Portfolio A: 0.139 BTC × $54k + $85k = **$92,500 (-7.5%)**
- Portfolio B: 0.463 BTC × $54k + $50k = **$75,000 (-25%)**
- Portfolio C: 0.926 BTC × $54k = **$50,000 (-50%)**
- **Framework saved $42,500 vs HODL**

**Scenario B: Macro Wins Rally (+20% to $130k)**
- Portfolio A: 0.139 BTC × $130k + $85k = **$103,000 (+3%)**
- Portfolio B: 0.463 BTC × $130k + $50k = **$110,200 (+10%)**
- Portfolio C: 0.926 BTC × $130k = **$120,400 (+20%)**
- **Framework underperforms, but can re-enter if score improves**

**Formulas for Google Sheets:**

Portfolio A (Framework 15%): `=(0.139 * BTC_Price) + 85000`
Portfolio B (50/50): `=(0.463 * BTC_Price) + 50000`
Portfolio C (100% BTC): `=0.926 * BTC_Price`

### Tab 5: Weekly Log

**Week 0: November 3-10, 2025 (BASELINE)**

**Score Summary:**
- Total: **4/12** (Macro: 3.05/4, Bitcoin: 1.1/4, Altcoin: N/A)
- Category: **DEFENSIVE MODE**
- Key Driver: **19 months post-halving = Late cycle distribution zone**

**Market Context:**
- Bitcoin: $108,000 (down from $126k ATH in October 2025)
- Pullback: 15-20% from peak (healthy correction or topping process?)
- Macro: Supportive (Fed cutting, M2 +4.8%, stocks ATH)
- Cycle: **DANGER ZONE** (historically top formation window)

**Framework Signals:**
- Triggered action: **YES - REDUCE from 100% to 15%**
- Score implication: Defensive (5-20% range, choose 15%)
- Timeframe: Execute this week (or scale over 2-4 weeks)

**Position Changes:**
- Previous: 100% Bitcoin (0.926 BTC at $108k = $100,000)
- Framework recommendation: 15% BTC, 85% stables
- Planned change: Sell 0.787 BTC → Keep 0.139 BTC + $85k stables
- Execution plan: [Fill in actual execution - immediate or scaled]
- Deviation from framework: [Yes/No - explain if yes]

**Reasoning:**
- **Why this score:**
  - Macro strong (3.05/4) = Bull market intact
  - Bitcoin weak (1.1/4) = Late cycle + overvalued + distribution
  - Combined 4/12 = Defensive mode
- **Why reduce despite macro support:**
  - 19 months post-halving historically = top formation
  - December 2017 precedent: $20k peak → $3k (-85%)
  - November 2021 precedent: $69k peak → $16k (-77%)
  - Framework says: Respect cycle timing over macro support
- **Conviction level:** 7/10 (high confidence in late cycle risk)
- **Risk factors:**
  - Could be "different this time" (ETFs, institutional adoption)
  - Macro very supportive (could extend rally to $150k+)
  - Selling "too early" at $108k if goes to $130k+

**Performance:**
- Week return: [Calculate after Nov 10]
- Total return since start: 0% (baseline week)
- vs 50/50 benchmark: 0% (baseline)
- vs 100% BTC benchmark: 0% (baseline)

**What Worked:**
1. [To be filled Week 1+]

**What Didn't Work:**
1. [To be filled Week 1+]

**Edge Cases / Refinements:**
1. Macro vs Cycle conflict: When outer circle (macro) is strong but cycle timing says late/danger
2. Framework says: Respect cycle in this case (Bitcoin-specific timing overrides in crypto context)
3. Monitor: If Bitcoin breaks new ATH AND score improves to 6-8/12, framework would say re-enter

**Next Week Preview:**
- Expected score direction: WATCH for deterioration to 2-3/12 (crash signal)
- Key events to watch: [Fill in economic calendar - CPI, Fed, etc.]
- Price alerts set: $95k, $85k, $75k (down), $120k, $126k (up)
- Likely action:
  - If score stays 4/12: HOLD 15%
  - If score drops to 2-3/12: REDUCE to 5-10%
  - If score improves to 5-6/12: HOLD or small add to 20%

**Framework Effectiveness:**

**The Big Question: Was Late Cycle Risk Real?**

**Scenario 1: Bitcoin Crashed (Framework Validated)**
- Framework predicted late cycle crash ✓
- Reducing to 15% protected capital ✓
- 100% HODL suffered major loss
- **RESULT:** Framework VALIDATED - cycle timing matters

**Scenario 2: Bitcoin Rallied to New ATH (Framework "Wrong"?)**
- Framework was "wrong" about immediate crash
- BUT: Did score improve to 6-8/12 allowing re-entry?
- If yes: Framework self-corrected ✓
- If no: Missed rally but preserved capital for next cycle
- **RESULT:** Test extended or framework needs refinement

**Scenario 3: Bitcoin Choppy/Sideways**
- Framework provided stability and lower stress
- Performance similar to benchmarks
- **RESULT:** Framework worked for risk management

**Strengths Identified:**
1. [What worked best - e.g., cycle timing, risk management, etc.]
2. [Second strength]
3. [Third strength]

**Weaknesses Identified:**
1. [What didn't work - e.g., missed signals, false alarms, etc.]
2. [Second weakness]
3. [Third weakness]

**Edge Cases Encountered:**
1. [Macro vs cycle timing conflict - how was it resolved?]
2. [Any scoring ambiguities in late cycle environment?]
3. [Other unexpected scenarios]

**Refinements Recommended for v2.0:**
1. [Specific refinement based on 8-week experience]
2. [Second refinement]
3. [Third refinement]

**Psychological Assessment:**
- Stress level (1-10): [X] vs [Y] for 100% BTC hold
- Confidence in framework: [1-10]
- Ease of execution: [1-10]
- Would use long-term: [Yes/No/With modifications]

**Final Decision:**
- [ ] Deploy framework long-term (validated)
- [ ] Refine and test another 4-8 weeks
- [ ] Major overhaul needed
- [ ] Abandon (fundamentally flawed)

**Lessons Learned:**
1. [Key lesson about late cycle risk management]
2. [Key lesson about macro vs cycle conflicts]
3. [Key lesson about position sizing discipline]
4. [Key lesson about emotional challenges]
5. [Key lesson about framework refinement process]

## Automation Ideas (Optional)

**Google Sheets Formulas:**

**Auto-calculate total score:**
`=SUM(B2:D2)` where B2=Macro, C2=Bitcoin, D2=Altcoin

**Auto-recommend position:**
```
=IF(E2<=2,"0-5% EXIT",
  IF(E2<=4,"5-20% DEFENSIVE",
  IF(E2<=6,"20-40% CAUTIOUS",
  IF(E2<=8,"40-60% BUILDING",
  IF(E2<=10,"60-80% AGGRESSIVE","80-100% MAXIMUM")))))
```

**Auto-calculate portfolio value (Framework 15%):**
`=(0.139 * BTC_Current_Price) + 85000`

**Week-over-week score change:**
`=E3-E2` where E=Total Score column

**Performance vs baseline:**
`=(Current_Value - $100,000) / $100,000` formatted as percentage

**Alert if score drops below 3:**
`=IF(E2<3, "⚠️ EXIT SIGNAL - Reduce to <5%", "")`

## CRITICAL REMINDER

**Week 0 Context:**
- Score: 4/12 (DEFENSIVE)
- Cycle: 19 months post-halving (LATE CYCLE)
- Strategy: REDUCE, don't accumulate
- Target: 15% BTC, 85% stables

**This is NOT 2024 early cycle "buy the dip"**
**This IS 2025 late cycle "sell the rip"**

**Historical precedent:**
- Dec 2017: 19mo post-halving = $20k peak → $3k (-85%)
- Nov 2021: 18mo post-halving = $69k peak → $16k (-77%)
- Nov 2025: 19mo post-halving = $126k peak → $108k now → ?

**Your test: Will framework protect capital in late cycle environment?**
