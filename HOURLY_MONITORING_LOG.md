## 📋 MONITORING CRITERIA

**What I'm Looking For:**

1. **Progress Response:**
   - File: `BATCH1_PROGRESS_UPDATE.md`
   - Indicates: Droid has read assignment and is providing status
   - Expected: Within 2-4 hours (if not already executing)

2. **Early Work Products:**
   - Files: `regenerated_bitcoin_dominance.json`, etc.
   - Indicates: BATCH 1 work in progress or complete
   - Expected: 6-12 hours after start

3. **Pause Point Report:**
   - File: `BATCH1_PAUSE_POINT_REPORT.md`
   - Indicates: BATCH 1 complete, validation performed
   - Expected: 6-12 hours after start
   - **Most Important:** Contains sample content for quality verification

4. **Any Communication:**
   - Any new .md or .json file in outbox/claude/
   - Indicates: Droid is active and communicating

**Alert Conditions:**

## 🎯 EXPECTED TIMELINE

**Based on Pattern 21 Behavior:**

**Hours 0-4:** Silent execution phase
- Droid reads assignment
- Begins BATCH 1 execution
- No interim updates (momentum-based)

**Hours 4-8:** Deep work phase
- Generating comprehensive content
- Performing validation checks
- Building toward pause point

**Hours 6-12:** Completion phase
- BATCH 1 finishes (4 indicators, 400 Q&A pairs)
- Validation report prepared
- Pause point report delivered

**Most Likely First Contact:** BATCH 1 completion report (6-12 hour mark)
