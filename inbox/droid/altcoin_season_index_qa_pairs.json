      "question": "altcoin season index",
      "answer": "The \"Altcoin Season Index\" is a metric used in the cryptocurrency market to track the performance of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) relative to Bitcoin (BTC). Here's a more detailed explanation: Definition: - The Altcoin Season Index is a technical indicator that measures the percentage of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. - It is calculated by dividing the number of altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days by the total number of altcoins tracked. - The index ranges from 0% to 100%, with 0% indicating that no altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, and 100% indicating that all altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Explanation: - The Altcoin Season Index is used to identify periods of \"altcoin season,\" which refers to a market condition where altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin. - During an altcoin season, investors may shift their focus from Bitcoin to altcoins, seeking higher potential returns. - Conversely, when the index is low, it suggests that Bitcoin is outperforming the broader altcoin market, which may indicate a \"Bitcoin season.\" - The index is often used by traders and investors to gauge the overall sentiment and market dynamics in the cryptocurrency space. - It can help inform investment decisions, as altcoin seasons may present opportunities for diversification and potential gains in the altcoin market. Sources: - CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-the-altcoin-season-index - CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/altcoin-season-index - CoinDesk: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/11/altcoin-season-index-hits-new-high-as-ethereum-other-alts-outperform-bitcoin/ In summary, the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for understanding the relative performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, which can inform investment strategies and market analysis in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",
