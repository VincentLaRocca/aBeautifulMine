   - `wma_qa_pairs.json`
   - `macd_qa_pairs.json`
   - `parabolic_sar_qa_pairs.json`
   - `ichimoku_tenkan_sen_qa_pairs.json`

- **Minimum Acceptable:** 80 Q&A pairs per indicator (800 total)
- **Target:** 100 Q&A pairs per indicator (1,000 total)
- **Success Rate:** 80%+ search success per indicator

### Priority Order (if executing sequentially):

**HIGHEST PRIORITY:**
1. RSI (most important, widely used)
2. MACD (critical trend/momentum combo)
3. SMA (fundamental indicator)

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
4. Aroon Indicator (completes Session 4)
5. Parabolic SAR (starts Session 3)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
6-8. All Ichimoku components (Tenkan, Kijun, Senkou A, Senkou B)
9. WMA (less critical than SMA)

---

## Expected Deliverables

**When Complete:**
- 10 research_report_*.txt files (raw format with ANSI codes)
- 10 JSON files (if you format them)
- ~1,000 Q&A pairs total
- Completion report

**Completion Signal:**
Create `BATCH_2_COMPLETE.txt` with summary:
- Total indicators completed
- Total Q&A pairs generated
- Any issues or notes

---

## Session Completion Impact

**If all 10 indicators completed:**

✅ **Session 2:** 5/5 indicators (100% complete)
✅ **Session 3:** 5/5 indicators (100% complete)
✅ **Session 4:** 5/5 indicators (100% complete)

**Database totals would reach:**
- 30 indicators total
- ~2,989 Q&A pairs total
- 3 full sessions complete (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

---

## Why These Are Critical

**Session 2 Gaps (SMA, WMA, MACD):**
- These are FUNDAMENTAL trend indicators
- Required baseline knowledge for crypto trading
- SMA and MACD especially are universally used

**Session 3 Complete Failure:**
- Entire session missing (0/5)
- Ichimoku is complex but powerful system
- Parabolic SAR is valuable trending indicator
- This was marked "complete" but wasn't

**Session 4 Gaps (Aroon, RSI):**
- RSI is one of THE most important indicators in crypto
- Aroon is excellent for trend identification
- Completing Session 4 gives us 5 full sessions

## Special Notes

### RSI - CRITICAL INDICATOR ⭐

RSI is probably the #1 most used momentum indicator in cryptocurrency trading. Give this special attention:

- Cover extensively (aim for 100 Q&A if possible)
- Deep dive on divergences
- Multiple examples with BTC, ETH, altcoins
- Explain adjusted thresholds for crypto volatility
- Cover use in bull markets vs bear markets
- Include DeFi and NFT applications if relevant

### Ichimoku System - 4 Components

Note that we already have Ichimoku Chikou Span (completed in Session 4). This batch adds the other 4 components:
- Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line) - short-term
- Kijun-sen (Base Line) - medium-term
- Senkou Span A (Leading Span A) - cloud boundary
- Senkou Span B (Leading Span B) - cloud boundary

Together with Chikou Span, this completes the full Ichimoku system.
