      "indicator": "Positive Volume Index (PVI)",
      "question": "What is Positive Volume Index (PVI) and how is it calculated?",
      "answer": "The Positive Volume Index (PVI) is a momentum-based technical indicator developed by Paul Dysart that focuses on price movements during periods of increased trading volume. It operates on the premise that 'uninformed' retail investors tend to be most active during high-volume periods, while 'smart money' institutional traders typically make strategic moves during low-volume periods. PVI serves as a critical counterpoint to the Negative Volume Index (NVI), together providing a comprehensive view of market participant behavior in cryptocurrency markets. PVI Calculation Formula: If today's volume > yesterday's volume: PVI change = (Today's close - Yesterday's close) ÷ Yesterday's close, PVI = Previous PVI + (PVI change × Volume ratio). Else: PVI = Previous PVI (no calculation on down-volume days)."

      "indicator": "Positive Volume Index (PVI)",
      "question": "How is PVI specifically used in cryptocurrency trading?",
      "answer": "Positive Volume Index has evolved into an essential tool for cryptocurrency trading, particularly in 2024-2025 markets characterized by institutional adoption and retail participation surges. As crypto markets mature beyond early adopter phases, understanding crowd dynamics through PVI analysis provides crucial insights into potential market turning points, institutional exits, and retail-driven momentum that often precede major market shifts. PVI excels at identifying periods of euphoric retail participation that often mark market tops. Rapid PVI increases combined with price rises indicate strong crowd buying, often unsustainable. PVI peaks frequently precede price peaks, suggesting retail crowd 'last in' to rallies."
    },
    {
      "indicator": "Positive Volume Index (PVI)",
      "question": "What are the optimal settings for PVI in crypto markets?",
      "answer": "Optimizing Positive Volume Index settings for cryptocurrency markets requires careful consideration of digital asset characteristics including 24/7 trading volume patterns, global retail participation cycles, exchange fragmentation, and institutional integration in 2024-2025 markets. The optimal PVI configuration balances crowd signal precision while accounting for crypto market's unique volume dynamics and cross-platform considerations. Standard Settings: Traditional PVI calculation starts from 1,000 as a baseline value with cumulative day-by-day accumulation. Moving averages for confirmation typically use 13-day EMA for short-term signals and 255-day EMA for long-term trend assessment in cryptocurrency markets."

    {
      "indicator": "Positive Volume Index (PVI)",
      "question": "What trading strategies work best with PVI in crypto?",
      "answer": "Positive Volume Index offers several sophisticated trading strategies specifically adapted for cryptocurrency markets where retail crowd dynamics can create significant moves and potential turning points. In 2024-2025 crypto markets with institutional participation and algorithmic trading evolution, PVI strategies excel at identifying crowd psychology patterns, retail exhaustion points, and opportunistic positioning against predictable retail behaviors. Retail Exhaustion Short Strategy: Entry trigger when PVI peaks and begins to decline while price still rising. Confirmation requirements include volume expansion with diminishing returns per unit. Position entry occurs when PVI crosses below 13-day EMA with price near recent highs."
    },
    {
      "indicator": "Positive Volume Index (PVI)",
      "question": "How can PVI be combined with other indicators?",
      "answer": "Combining Positive Volume Index with complementary indicators creates a comprehensive trading system that enhances signal reliability and decision-making quality in cryptocurrency markets. The most effective integrations leverage PVI's crowd behavior insights alongside indicators that measure different market aspects—smart money activity, on-chain metrics, price momentum, volatility patterns, and fundamental network health—for multi-dimensional trading confirmation. Primary Combinations: PVI + NVI (Negative Volume Index) creates a dual-indicator system for retail vs. institutional behavior analysis. PVI + On-Chain Metrics validates retail activity against fundamental network growth. PVI + Moving Averages provides crowd momentum confirmation through price trend alignment."

      "indicator": "Positive Volume Index (PVI)",
      "question": "What are common mistakes when using PVI in crypto markets?",
      "answer": "Using Positive Volume Index effectively in cryptocurrency markets requires avoiding common mistakes that stem from applying traditional volume indicators without accounting for digital asset market characteristics. These errors range from calculation methodology issues to interpretation problems that significantly diminish PVI's effectiveness for identifying genuine retail patterns. Common Calculation Errors: Using incorrect volume thresholds that don't account for crypto 24/7 trading patterns. Applying traditional stock market session boundaries instead of cryptocurrency 24-hour cycles. Failing to account for exchange fragmentation and volume distribution across multiple venues. Interpretation Mistakes: Treating PVI as a standalone indicator without institutional confirmation. Ignoring cross-exchange PVI divergence warnings."

      "indicator": "Active Addresses (Daily)",
      "question": "What is Active Addresses (Daily) and how is it measured?",
      "answer": "Active Addresses (Daily) is a fundamental on-chain metric that measures the number of unique cryptocurrency wallet addresses that participate in at least one successful transaction during a 24-hour period. This critical blockchain metric serves as a real-time barometer for network engagement, user adoption, and ecosystem health, providing cryptocurrency traders and analysts with transparent insights into blockchain demand and utilization patterns beyond traditional volume-based analysis. An address is considered 'active' for a given day when it either sends a transaction (outgoing), receives a transaction (incoming), or performs both sending and receiving activities."
