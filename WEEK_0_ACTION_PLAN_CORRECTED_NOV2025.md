# Week 0 Action Plan: Framework Deployment (CORRECTED FOR NOV 2025)

**Date:** November 3-10, 2025
**Objective:** Execute DEFENSIVE position and set up tracking infrastructure

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION

**This replaces WEEK_0_ACTION_PLAN.md which had wrong year/cycle position.**

**Key Difference:**
- **Wrong (2024):** 6 months post-halving, score 5/12, 30% BTC position (BUILD)
- **Correct (2025):** 19 months post-halving, score 4/12, 15% BTC position (REDUCE)

**Strategy:** DEFENSIVE - Take profits, not accumulate

---

## Today (Sunday, November 3, 2025) - 2 Hours

### ✅ Task 1: Review Framework Score (CORRECTED)
- Current score: **4/12** (was incorrectly calculated as 5/12)
- Recommended position: **15% BTC, 0% alts, 85% stables**
- Reasoning: **LATE CYCLE (19 months post-halving) - Historically top formation zone**

### ✅ Task 2: Make Position Decision (1 hour)

**Your Current Portfolio:** Assume $100,000 (100% Bitcoin at $108k)

**Framework Recommendation:**
- Bitcoin: **15%** (REDUCE from 100%)
- Altcoins: 0% (prerequisites not met, score too low)
- Stablecoins: **85%** (SAFETY - prepare for potential -50% crash)

**Calculate Your Reduction:**
```
Current Portfolio: $100,000 (100% BTC)
Current BTC: 0.926 BTC at $108,000

Target Position:
Bitcoin (15%): $15,000 (0.139 BTC)
Stablecoins (85%): $85,000

NEED TO SELL: 0.787 BTC ($85,000)
```

**Decision Points:**

**Option A: Framework Strict (Recommended for Score 4/12)**
- Sell 80% of Bitcoin THIS WEEK (reduce to 20%)
- Sell final 5% next week (reduce to 15%)
- Execute: Monday-Wednesday (don't wait)
- Rationale: Late cycle risk is REAL (Dec 2017, Nov 2021 precedents)

**Option B: Framework Balanced (Scaled Approach)**
- Week 1: Sell 40% → 60% position
- Week 2: Sell 25% → 35% position
- Week 3: Sell 15% → 20% position
- Week 4: Sell 5% → 15% position
- Rationale: Reduce risk of selling exact bottom, but still get defensive

**Option C: Conditional Sells (Aggressive/Hopeful)**
- Set limit sells: 25% at $115k, 25% at $120k, 30% at $125k
- Keep 20% long-term
- Risk: May NEVER fill if Bitcoin dumps to $80k
- Rationale: Trying to sell strength, but may not get chance

**Option D: Observation Mode Only (High Risk)**
- Keep 100% Bitcoin
- Track framework scores weekly
- See if framework would have protected capital
- Risk: Could lose 50-75% if late cycle pattern repeats
- Rationale: "This time is different" bet on macro support

**Framework Recommends: Option A or B**

**Your Choice:** [ ] A  [ ] B  [ ] C  [ ] D

---

## Monday-Tuesday (Nov 4-5) - Execute Position

### Task 3: Execute Trades (CRITICAL)

**If Following Option A (Strict - Reduce to 20% this week):**

**Sell Order 1: 40% of Bitcoin (Monday)**
- Sell: 0.370 BTC at market or limit $107k-108k
- Receive: ~$40,000 USDC
- Remaining: 0.556 BTC (60% position)

**Sell Order 2: 40% of Bitcoin (Tuesday-Wednesday)**
- Sell: 0.370 BTC at market or limit $106k-108k
- Receive: ~$40,000 USDC
- Remaining: 0.186 BTC (20% position)

**Record Entry:**
```
Date executed: ___________
Sell 1: 0.370 BTC at $_________
Sell 2: 0.370 BTC at $_________
Average sell price: $_________
Remaining: 0.186 BTC (20% position)
Stablecoin balance: ~$80,000
Total portfolio value: $_________
```

**If Following Option B (Scaled - Reduce to 60% this week):**
- Sell: 0.370 BTC (40% of holdings)
- Move to stablecoins: $40,000
- Remaining: 0.556 BTC (60% position)
- Continue scaling next 3 weeks

---

## Wednesday (Nov 6) - Set Up Tracking

### Task 4: Create Tracking Spreadsheet (45 minutes)

**Option A: Google Sheets (Recommended)**
1. Copy template from FRAMEWORK_TRACKING_SPREADSHEET.md
2. Fill in Week 0 baseline data (**CORRECTED**)
3. Set up formulas for auto-calculation

**Baseline Entry (CORRECTED):**
```
Week 0 (Nov 3, 2025):
- Score: 4/12 (Macro 3.05, Bitcoin 1.1, Alts N/A)
- Cycle Position: 19 months post-halving (LATE CYCLE)
- Position: 15% BTC target (or 20-60% if scaling)
- BTC Price: $108,000
- Portfolio Value: $100,000
- Strategy: DEFENSIVE - Reduce, don't accumulate
```

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Weekly score changes (watch for 2-3/12 = full exit signal)
- Position changes (are you following framework?)
- Drawdown protection (vs 100% BTC hold)

---

## Thursday (Nov 7) - Set Up Infrastructure

### Task 5: Bookmark Data Sources (15 minutes)

**Create bookmark folder: "Framework Data Sources"**

**Macro:**
- [ ] https://fred.stlouisfed.org (Fed data, M2)
- [ ] https://www.tradingview.com (DXY, yields, stocks)
- [ ] https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/ (VIX)

**Bitcoin:**
- [ ] https://cryptoquant.com or https://studio.glassnode.com (on-chain)
- [ ] https://www.lookintobitcoin.com (valuation metrics, 200W MA, MVRV, Pi Cycle)
- [ ] https://farside.co.uk/btc/ (ETF flows)

**Altcoins:**
- [ ] https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/ (Bitcoin dominance)
- [ ] https://coinmarketcap.com (sectors)
- [ ] https://defillama.com (stablecoins)

### Task 6: Set Calendar Reminders (10 minutes)

**Recurring Event:**
- [ ] Every Sunday, 9:00 AM
- [ ] Title: "Score Framework + Adjust Position"
- [ ] Duration: 1 hour
- [ ] Location: Home office/quiet space
- [ ] Reminder: Saturday 8 PM ("Prepare for tomorrow's scoring")

**Special Event Reminders (Nov-Dec 2025):**
- [ ] Check economic calendar for Fed meetings, CPI, jobs reports
- [ ] Set day-before alerts for major macro events

---

## Friday (Nov 8) - Set Alerts

### Task 7: Price Alerts (15 minutes)

**On your exchange or TradingView, set these Bitcoin price alerts:**

**DOWNSIDE (Reduce Further or Exit):**
- [ ] **$95,000** (Support level, score likely 3/12, consider reducing to 10%)
- [ ] **$85,000** (Major support break, score likely 2/12, reduce to 5%)
- [ ] **$75,000** (Severe break, score likely 1/12, EXIT to 0-5%)

**UPSIDE (Reassess - Could Be Wrong):**
- [ ] **$120,000** (Approaching ATH retest)
- [ ] **$126,000** (ATH retest, rescore framework)
- [ ] **$135,000** (New ATH, framework may need recalibration if macro very strong)

**Set SMS/Email Alerts:**
- Choose: **SMS for critical levels ($85k, $120k)**
- Choose: Email for informational levels ($95k, $115k)

**CRITICAL:** Downside alerts more important than upside in late cycle

### Task 8: Event Alerts (10 minutes)

**Add to calendar (Check actual 2025 economic calendar):**
- [ ] November CPI Report (usually mid-month, ~8:30 AM ET)
- [ ] December FOMC Meeting (usually mid-month)
- [ ] Any major geopolitical events

**Set reminders:**
- Day before each event: "Major macro event tomorrow, review framework score"

---

## Weekend (Nov 9-10) - First Official Score

### Task 9: Sunday Morning Routine (45 minutes)

**9:00 AM - Start Framework Scoring**

**Step 1: Gather Data (15 min)**
- Open all bookmarked sources
- Record current values for all 12 indicators
- **CRITICAL:** Note any major events from past week (did Bitcoin crash? rally?)

**Step 2: Score Framework (15 min)**
- Calculate macro score /4
- Calculate Bitcoin score /4 (**cycle position still 0.0/1.0 in late cycle**)
- Check altcoin prerequisites (likely still fail)
- Total score /12

**Step 3: Compare to Week 0 (5 min)**
- Last week: **4/12**
- This week: __/12
- Change: [+/- X]
- Category: [Improvement, Stable, Deterioration]

**Step 4: Determine Action (5 min)**

**If score IMPROVES to 5-6/12:**
- Framework says: 20-40% BTC
- Current position: 15-20%
- Action: HOLD or small add (but cautious - still late cycle)

**If score STAYS 4/12:**
- Framework says: 15% BTC
- Current position: 15-20%
- Action: HOLD current position

**If score DETERIORATES to 2-3/12:**
- Framework says: 5-10% BTC
- Current position: 15-20%
- Action: **REDUCE FURTHER** - sell another 5-10%

**If score COLLAPSES to 0-2/12:**
- Framework says: 0-5% BTC
- Action: **EMERGENCY EXIT** - sell to <5% within 48 hours

**Step 5: Log & Plan (5 min)**
- Update tracking spreadsheet
- Write weekly log entry
- Set next week's alerts
- Note: Did you follow framework? Any overrides?

## Quick Decisions Guide

**Question: Should I sell Bitcoin at $108k or wait for $120k?**

Answer: Framework says 4/12 = REDUCE NOW. Score is defensive mode (late cycle). If you wait for $120k:
- Option 1: Might get lucky, sell at $120k (but framework says it's late)
- Option 2: Bitcoin dumps to $90k before you sell
- Option 3: Sell 50% now at $108k, set limit sells for other 35% at $115-125k, keep 15%

**Question: What if Bitcoin crashes 20% this week to $86k?**

Answer:
1. Sunday: Rescore framework
2. If score drops to 2-3/12 (likely with crash): Reduce to 5-10%
3. Framework would have you selling at $95k-100k (less painful than $86k, but still protected vs $108k)
4. This is WHY we reduce EARLY - to avoid panic selling at bottom

**Question: What if Bitcoin rallies 20% this week to $130k (new ATH)?**

Answer:
1. Sunday: Rescore framework
2. If score IMPROVES to 6-7/12 (macro + momentum): Consider re-adding to 30-40%
3. If score STAYS 4/12: **DON'T CHASE** - you reduced for a reason (late cycle)
4. Framework prevents FOMO by requiring score improvement to add

**Question: Should I buy altcoins?**

Answer: **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** Prerequisites severely failing:
- Bitcoin score: 1.1/4 (need ≥3/4) - FAIL
- Combined score: 4.15/8 (need ≥6/8) - FAIL
- Late cycle: Altcoins will crash -70% to -90% if Bitcoin dumps
- Wait for framework to green-light altcoins (needs 6-8/12 score minimum)

**Question: What if I disagree with the framework? Macro IS supportive (3.05/4)!**

Answer:
1. This is a TEST - try to follow it for 8 weeks
2. You're right that macro is supportive (Fed cutting, M2 positive)
3. BUT: 19 months post-halving overrides macro (93/7 rule in REVERSE here)
4. Historical precedent: Dec 2017 and Nov 2021 had supportive macro too
5. If you're VERY confident macro wins: Keep 30-40% BTC (but that's overriding framework)
6. Log your disagreement and reasoning
7. After 8 weeks, compare: Did framework protect capital or miss opportunity?

## Week 0 Position Summary (CORRECTED)

**Starting Portfolio:** $100,000 (100% Bitcoin at $108k)

**Week 0 Allocation (TARGET):**
- Bitcoin: $15,000 (15%, ~0.139 BTC)
- Stablecoins: $85,000 (85%, USDC/USDT)

**Reduction Needed:**
- Sell: 0.787 BTC (~$85,000)
- Execute: This week (Option A) or scaled over 4 weeks (Option B)

**Next Review:** Sunday, November 10, 2025

**Expected Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Bitcoin Crashes (-20% to $86k)**
- Portfolio (15% BTC): $12,900 BTC + $85k stables = $97,900 (-2%)
- Portfolio (100% BTC): $86,000 (-14%)
- **Framework saved you 12%**

**Scenario B: Bitcoin Rallies (+15% to $124k)**
- Portfolio (15% BTC): $17,200 BTC + $85k stables = $102,200 (+2%)
- Portfolio (100% BTC): $124,000 (+15%)
- **Framework cost you 13% BUT can re-enter if score improves**

**Scenario C: Bitcoin Stable (±5% around $105k-112k)**
- Portfolio (15% BTC): ~$100,000 to $102,000 (low stress)
- Portfolio (100% BTC): ~$97,000 to $104,000 (high volatility)
- **Framework provides stability**

## Mental Preparation

**This week, focus on:**
1. ✓ Execution discipline (REDUCE to 15%, don't second-guess)
2. ✓ Infrastructure setup (boring but critical)
3. ✓ Building the habit (Sunday scoring routine)
4. ✓ **Accepting discomfort** (reducing at $108k feels wrong, but late cycle demands it)

**This week, avoid:**
1. ✗ Checking price constantly (once per day max)
2. ✗ FOMO on "one more pump to $130k" (late cycle is dangerous)
3. ✗ Overriding the framework (it's a test, follow strictly)
4. ✗ Buying altcoins (prerequisites catastrophically failing)

**Remember:**
- This is a PROOF OF CONCEPT
- You're testing whether 19 months post-halving matters (historically it does)
- 8 weeks is enough to see if Bitcoin crashes, consolidates, or rallies
- The goal is to LEARN and PROTECT CAPITAL, not to get rich quick
- **Process > Outcome** (for now)

**Historical Context:**
- December 2017: 19 months post-halving, $20k peak → $3k bottom (-85%)
- November 2021: 18 months post-halving, $69k peak → $16k bottom (-77%)
- November 2025: 19 months post-halving, $126k peak → $106k now... → ?

**Framework bet:** History repeats, reduce now, re-enter later at 6-8/12 score

**Macro optimist bet:** This time is different, ETFs change everything, hold 100%

**8 weeks will tell us who's right.** 🎯

## CRITICAL DECISION (Make This Week)

**I will follow the framework by:**
- [ ] **Option A:** Reducing to 20% this week, 15% next week (strict)
- [ ] **Option B:** Scaling to 15% over 4 weeks (balanced)
- [ ] **Option C:** Setting conditional sells at $115k-125k (risky)
- [ ] **Option D:** Observing only, keeping 100% (VERY risky, not following framework)

**I understand that:**
- [ ] Framework score 4/12 = Defensive mode (5-20% position)
- [ ] 19 months post-halving = Late cycle (historically top formation)
- [ ] Macro support (3.05/4) does NOT override cycle position (93/7 rule)
- [ ] If I override framework, I'm betting "this time is different"
- [ ] I will track my decision and results honestly for 8 weeks
