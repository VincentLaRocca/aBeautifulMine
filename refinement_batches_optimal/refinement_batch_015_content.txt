Question: technical methodology behind calculating "active addresses daily" in cryptocurrency
Answer: Here is a comprehensive overview of the technical methodology behind calculating "active addresses daily" in cryptocurrency:

Definition:
- Active addresses daily refers to the number of unique cryptocurrency addresses that were involved in at least one transaction on a given day.
- This metric is used to gauge the level of user activity and adoption for a particular cryptocurrency network.

Technical Methodology:
1. Transaction Data Collection:
   - Cryptocurrency blockchains store a complete record of all transactions that have occurred on the network.
   - Blockchain explorers and API services are used to access and extract this raw transaction data.

2. Address Identification:
   - Each cryptocurrency transaction involves one or more input addresses (where the funds are sent from) and one or more output addresses (where the funds are sent to).
   - The unique addresses involved in each transaction are identified and counted.

3. Address Deduplication:
   - Many users may have multiple addresses associated with their cryptocurrency wallets.
   - To avoid double-counting, the methodology involves deduplicating the addresses to only count unique addresses that were active on that day.

4. Daily Aggregation:
   - The number of unique active addresses is tallied and aggregated on a daily basis.
   - This provides the "active addresses daily" metric for that particular cryptocurrency network.

Data Sources:
- Blockchain explorers like Etherscan, BlockCypher, and Blockchain.com
- Cryptocurrency API services like Coingecko, CoinMetrics, and Messari
- Direct access to full blockchain node data

Limitations and Considerations:
- The metric only counts addresses that were involved in at least one transaction on a given day.
  Addresses that held funds but did not transact are not included.
- Addresses controlled by exchanges, wallets, or services may skew the active address count.
- Differences in address management and user behavior across cryptocurrencies can affect comparability.
- The metric provides a high-level view of network activity but does not capture nuances like transaction volumes or value transferred.

In summary, the "active addresses daily" metric for cryptocurrencies is calculated by identifying and deduplicating the unique addresses involved in transactions on a given day, using data extracted directly from blockchain records. This provides a useful proxy for measuring user activity and adoption trends within a cryptocurrency network.
