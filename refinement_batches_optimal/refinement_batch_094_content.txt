These protocols help address some of the limitations of layer 1 blockchains, such as high transaction fees, slow transaction times, and limited throughput.

1. Sidechains:
   - Sidechains are independent blockchain networks that are connected to and secured by a main blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
   - They allow for the transfer of assets and data between the sidechain and the main blockchain, enabling cross-chain interoperability.
   - Examples of sidechain projects include Liquid (for Bitcoin) and Polygon (for Ethereum).

2. Plasma:
   - Plasma is a framework for building scalable decentralized applications (dApps) on top of a root blockchain, such as Ethereum.
   - It uses a series of child blockchains, called Plasma chains, to process transactions off the main blockchain, reducing the load on the root chain.
   - Plasma enables fast and cheap transactions while still benefiting from the security of the root blockchain.

3. Rollups:
   - Rollups are a type of layer 2 solution that performs transaction processing and state updates off the main blockchain, then "rolls up" the data and submits it to the root chain.
   - There are two main types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups.
   - Optimistic rollups assume that transactions are valid by default, while ZK rollups use cryptographic proofs to verify the validity of transactions.
   - Examples of rollup projects include Arbitrum, Optimism, and Loopring.

4. State Channels:
   - State channels are a type of layer 2 solution that allows participants to conduct off-chain transactions while still benefiting from the security of the root blockchain.
   - Participants can open a state channel, conduct numerous transactions, and then close the channel, with the final state being recorded on the root blockchain.
   - This reduces the number of on-chain transactions, improving scalability and reducing fees.
   - Examples of state channel projects include Lightning Network (for Bitcoin) and Raiden Network (for Ethereum).

   - The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that the rights management system is transparent, tamper-resistant, and not controlled by a single entity.
   - Examples of blockchain-based DRM projects include Mediachain, OPUS, and Binded.

2. Decentralized Identities and Self-Sovereign Identity:
   - Decentralized identity (DID) and self-sovereign identity (SSI) are concepts that empower individuals to have more control over their digital identities and personal data.
   - In a decentralized DRM system, DIDs and SSI can be used to authenticate users, verify ownership, and grant access to digital content and assets.
   - This allows for more granular control and management of digital rights, as users can directly control and manage their own digital identities and permissions.
   - Examples of DID and SSI projects include Decentralized Identity Foundation, uPort, and Sovrin.

3. Decentralized Storage and Content Distribution:
   - Decentralized storage solutions, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Filecoin, can be integrated with DRM systems to store and distribute digital content in a decentralized manner.
   - This helps ensure the integrity and availability of the content, as it is not controlled by a single entity.
   - Decentralized content distribution networks can also be used to deliver digital content to users while enforcing the associated rights and permissions.
   - Examples of projects combining decentralized storage and DRM include Arweave, Livepeer, and Theta Network.

These are the key aspects of layer 2 interoperability protocols and decentralized digital rights management. For more detailed information, I recommend referring to the whitepapers, technical documentation, and research papers of the specific projects and protocols mentioned.
