**Recommended Approach:**
Start with Tier 1 professional education channels (Coin Bureau, Benjamin Cowen, InvestAnswers) to establish foundational market knowledge Q&As. Progress to Tier 2 technical channels for DeFi mechanics, then Tier 4 developer channels for smart contract education. Use Tier 3 trading channels selectively for market psychology and sentiment analysis.

**Expected Outcome:**
With proper transcript extraction and Q&A generation, these 20 channels should yield 7,000-10,000 high-quality Q&A pairs, achieving 102%+ of the 30,000-pair database goal and providing comprehensive cryptocurrency knowledge coverage.
