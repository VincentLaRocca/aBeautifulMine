## 2. Market Mechanics Deep-Dive

### How Polygon Prediction Markets Work

#### Step 1: Market Creation

1. User proposes a market with binary or multiple outcomes
2. Question must be verifiable and have clear resolution criteria
3. Market maker provides initial liquidity
4. Outcome tokens minted as ERC-1155 on Polygon

#### Step 2: Trading Phase

1. Users buy/sell outcome tokens using USDC (on Polygon)
2. Prices reflect market probability (0-100%)
3. Automated Market Maker (AMM) provides liquidity
4. Order book matching for larger trades (Polymarket CLOB)
5. Near-zero gas fees enable frequent trading

#### Step 3: Resolution

**UMA Oracle (Traditional Markets):**
1. Market closes at predetermined time
2. Proposer submits outcome
3. Challenge period (anyone can dispute)
4. If disputed, UMA token holders vote
5. Winning outcome determined

**Chainlink Oracle (Price Markets - Sept 2025):**
1. Market closes at predetermined time
2. Chainlink Data Streams provide verified price
3. Chainlink Automation executes settlement on-chain
4. Near-instant resolution (no dispute period)
5. Cryptographic guarantees

#### Step 4: Settlement

1. Winning tokens redeem for $1 USDC each
2. Losing tokens become worthless
3. Automatic settlement via smart contracts
4. Funds distributed to wallets instantly

### Tokenomics

**Collateral:**
- **Primary:** USDC (USD Coin on Polygon)
- **Ratio:** $1 USDC → 1 set of outcome tokens
- **Example:** Binary market creates 2 tokens per $1 deposited

**Outcome Tokens:**
- **Standard:** ERC-1155 (Gnosis Conditional Tokens)
- **Tradeable:** Can be bought/sold before resolution
- **Redemption:** Winning tokens → $1 USDC each

**Fees:**
- **Trading Fee:** ~1-2% (taken by market maker/liquidity providers)
- **Gas Fee:** $0.007 average (Polygon network)
- **Withdrawal:** Minimal (Polygon → L1 bridge if needed)

### Oracle Integration

#### UMA Optimistic Oracle (Traditional System)

**How It Works:**
1. **Optimistic Assumption:** Proposed outcomes assumed true
2. **Challenge Period:** Typically 2-24 hours
3. **Dispute Bond:** Challenger must post bond (risk/reward mechanism)
4. **Voting:** UMA token holders vote if disputed
5. **Resolution:** Majority vote determines outcome

**2025 Upgrade - MOOV2:**
- Only whitelisted members can propose resolutions
- Reduces spam and improves accuracy
- Anyone can still dispute
- Enhanced security for Polymarket markets

**Pros:**
- Handles subjective or complex questions
- Decentralized resolution
- Proven track record

**Cons:**
- Slower (requires challenge period)
- Potential for disputes
- Human voting introduces subjectivity

#### Chainlink Integration (September 2025 - Price Markets)

**How It Works:**
1. **Data Streams:** Low-latency, timestamped market prices
2. **Automation:** On-chain execution at predetermined times
3. **Verification:** Cryptographic proofs of price data
4. **Settlement:** Instant resolution when market closes

**Use Cases:**
- Bitcoin price predictions
- Ethereum price markets
- Any objective, verifiable data (weather, sports scores, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Near-instant resolution
- Eliminates dispute delays
- Objective, verifiable data
- Cryptographic guarantees

**Cons:**
- Limited to objective data points
- Requires reliable data source
- More expensive than UMA (oracle costs)

### Liquidity Models

#### Automated Market Maker (AMM)

**Polymarket FPMM (Fixed Product Market Maker):**
```
x * y = k (constant product formula)
```

- Provides continuous liquidity
- Price adjusts based on buys/sells
- No order book needed for small trades
- Slippage increases with trade size

#### CLOB (Central Limit Order Book)

**Polymarket's 2023+ Upgrade:**
- Order book matching for larger trades
- Better pricing for sophisticated traders
- Reduced slippage
- Hybrid approach: AMM + CLOB

#### Liquidity Provision

- Market creators provide initial liquidity
- LPs earn fees from trading activity
- Risk: Impermanent loss if market moves
- Returns: 1-2% of trading volume
