## 💡 Key Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Action: Build Market Intelligence Category
This is your BIGGEST GAP and highest value for predictive trading.

**Priority Order:**
1. Early Signal Detection (most predictive)
2. Catalyst Identification (timing opportunities)
3. Market Microstructure (execution intelligence)
4. Narrative & Sector Rotation (trend following)
5. CEX-Specific Intelligence (venue optimization)

### 2. Refocus Fundamentals
Don't build ALL 933 fundamental subtopics. Build only the ~225 that matter for:
- Understanding catalysts (why price will move)
- Competitive positioning (which coins benefit from trends)
- Risk assessment (protocol risks, token unlocks)

### 3. Prioritize CEX Trading Mechanics
You need to know HOW to execute once you spot the signal.
- Order types, leverage, risk management
- 100 subtopics is sufficient (not 200+)

### 4. Leverage Existing Technical Analysis
You're already building 227 indicators. Many include on-chain, derivatives, and sentiment.
- Extract the predictive ones
- De-prioritize lagging indicators
