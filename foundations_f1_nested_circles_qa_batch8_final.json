    "question": "How do you use the nested circles framework to identify when Bitcoin is leading macro (rare occurrence) versus following macro (normal)?",
    "answer": "Understanding when Bitcoin is leading versus lagging macro is critical for identifying the rare 1-in-15 paradigm shift moments versus the normal 14-in-15 situations where macro dominates. Here's how to detect the difference:\n\n**NORMAL STATE: Bitcoin Follows Macro (93-95% of Time)**\n\n**Characteristics:**\n\n**1. Time Lag Structure**\n- Macro events happen → Bitcoin responds 1-3 days later\n- Fed announces policy → Bitcoin reacts within 24-48 hours\n- M2 data released → Bitcoin adjusts over days/weeks\n\n**Example - Fed Rate Decision (September 2024):**\n- September 18, 2024: Fed cuts 50bps (first cut since 2020)\n- Bitcoin: $60k → $64k within 48 hours (+6.7%)\n- **Pattern**: Macro signal → Bitcoin response (FOLLOWING)\n\n**2. Correlation Persistence**\n- Bitcoin-to-Nasdaq correlation: 0.6-0.8\n- When Nasdaq up 2%, Bitcoin up 3-4% (leveraged following)\n- When Nasdaq down 2%, Bitcoin down 3-4%\n\n**3. Directional Consistency**\n- Macro turns bullish (Fed easing) → Bitcoin rallies\n- Macro turns bearish (Fed hiking) → Bitcoin crashes\n- No divergence, Bitcoin amplifies macro direction\n\n**How to Confirm Bitcoin is Following:**\n\nCheck these 3 conditions daily:\n\n□ **Condition 1: Price Action Timing**\n- Does Bitcoin move AFTER major macro news/events?\n- Example: CPI data at 8:30 AM ET → Bitcoin moves 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM\n- If YES: Bitcoin is following\n\n□ **Condition 2: Correlation Window**\n- Calculate 30-day rolling correlation (Bitcoin vs SPX or Nasdaq)\n- If correlation > 0.5: Bitcoin is following macro\n- If correlation < 0.3: Potential leading or divergence\n\n□ **Condition 3: Volume Pattern**\n- Does Bitcoin volume spike AFTER macro events?\n- Does Bitcoin volume lead or lag stock market volume?\n- Following = Volume lags macro by hours/days\n\n**If all 3 conditions = YES: Bitcoin is in FOLLOWING mode (normal state)**\n\n---\n\n**RARE STATE: Bitcoin Leads Macro (5-7% of Time)**\n\n**Characteristics:**\n\n**1. Time Lag Reversal**\n- Bitcoin moves BEFORE macro signals\n- Bitcoin bottoms/tops 1-3 months before stocks\n- Bitcoin anticipates Fed pivots\n\n**Example - November 2022 Bottom:**\n- Bitcoin bottomed: November 21, 2022 at $15,476\n- S&P 500 bottomed: October 12, 2022 at 3,577\n- **BUT**: Bitcoin made HIGHER LOW in November vs October\n- Bitcoin led the recovery by signaling bottom confirmation early\n- Nasdaq didn't confirm until January 2023\n\n**Pattern**: Bitcoin moved first, stocks followed weeks later (LEADING)\n\n**2. Correlation Breakdown**\n- Bitcoin-to-Nasdaq correlation drops < 0.3 (sometimes negative)\n- Bitcoin rallies while stocks fall (or vice versa)\n- Sustained divergence for weeks/months\n\n**Example - Q4 2023:**\n- October-December 2023: Bitcoin +60% ($27k → $44k)\n- S&P 500 same period: +14% (4,100 → 4,700)\n- Bitcoin outperformed by 4.3x\n- **Why**: BlackRock ETF anticipation (Bitcoin-specific catalyst)\n\n**3. Crypto-Specific Catalysts Dominating**\n- Bitcoin moves on crypto news (ETF, halving, regulation)\n- Macro news has muted impact on Bitcoin\n- Stablecoin supply rising (capital entering crypto independent of stocks)\n\n---\n\n**THE LEADING INDICATORS FRAMEWORK:**\n\n**When Bitcoin is truly leading (not just noise), you'll see:**\n\n**Leading Indicator #1: Bitcoin Bottoms/Tops 1-3 Months Before Stocks**\n\n**Historical Validation:**\n\n**2018 Bottom:**\n- Bitcoin bottom: December 15, 2018 ($3,122)\n- S&P 500 bottom: December 24, 2018 (2,346) \n- **Bitcoin led by 9 days** (early signal)\n\n**2020 COVID Bottom:**\n- Bitcoin bottom: March 13, 2020 ($3,858)\n- S&P 500 bottom: March 23, 2020 (2,237)\n- **Bitcoin led by 10 days**\n\n**2021 Top:**\n- Bitcoin top: November 10, 2021 ($69k)\n- Nasdaq top: November 22, 2021 (16,212)\n- **Bitcoin led by 12 days**\n\n**Pattern**: Bitcoin often bottoms/tops 1-2 weeks before major indices during turning points. This is NOT leading macro (still responding to same forces), but it's leading stocks.\n\n**Leading Indicator #2: Divergence Duration > 4 Weeks**\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nDivergence Strength = |Bitcoin % Change - Nasdaq % Change| over 30 days\n\nIf Divergence Strength > 20% for 4+ weeks = Potential Leading\n```\n\n**Example - Q4 2023:**\n- 30-day Bitcoin return: +40%\n- 30-day Nasdaq return: +10%\n- Divergence: 30 percentage points\n- Duration: 8 weeks\n- **Verdict**: Bitcoin LEADING (ETF catalyst)\n\n**Leading Indicator #3: Stablecoin Supply Diverges from Stock Market Liquidity**\n\n**Normal (Following):**\n- Stocks up + liquidity rising → Stablecoin supply up\n- Stocks down + liquidity falling → Stablecoin supply down\n- Correlation: Stablecoins follow stock market liquidity\n\n**Leading:**\n- Stocks sideways/down BUT stablecoin supply surging\n- New capital entering crypto DESPITE macro caution\n- Crypto-specific demand independent of macro\n\n**Example - Mid-2023:**\n- Stocks: Range-bound (SPX 4,200-4,500)\n- Stablecoin supply: +15% ($120B → $138B)\n- Bitcoin: +50% in same period\n- **Verdict**: Crypto-specific capital inflows (leading)\n\n---\n\n**THE 4-STEP LEADING DETECTION PROTOCOL:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Correlation (Weekly)**\n\nUse this formula:\n```\nBitcoin-Macro Correlation = CORREL(BTC daily returns, SPX daily returns, 30-day window)\n\nIf < 0.3 for 2+ weeks: Potential leading/divergence\nIf 0.3-0.6: Mixed signals\nIf > 0.6: Definitely following (normal)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Check Time Lags**\n\nDoes Bitcoin react BEFORE or AFTER major macro events?\n\n**Test Cases (Past Week):**\n- Fed announcement: Did Bitcoin move before or after?\n- Jobs report: Did Bitcoin anticipate or react?\n- CPI data: Did Bitcoin front-run or follow?\n\nIf Bitcoin moves 6-24 hours BEFORE news: Potential leading (or insider trading leak)\nIf Bitcoin moves 1-48 hours AFTER news: Following (normal)\n\n**Step 3: Identify Crypto-Specific Catalysts**\n\nIs there a Bitcoin/crypto-specific event driving price?\n\n**Crypto-Specific Catalysts:**\n- ETF approvals/denials\n- Major exchange listings\n- Protocol upgrades (Ethereum Merge, Bitcoin Taproot)\n- Regulatory clarity (XRP lawsuit win)\n- Halving events\n- Major hacks/collapses (negative catalysts)\n\nIf YES + Bitcoin diverging from macro: Bitcoin may be leading on crypto-specific factors\n\n**Step 4: Validate with Volume and Flows**\n\n**Leading indicators:**\n- Bitcoin spot volume rising while stock volume stable/falling\n- Stablecoin supply rising (new capital)\n- Exchange reserves falling (accumulation despite macro caution)\n- Institutional flows positive (ETFs, corporate treasuries buying)\n\nIf 3+ of these = TRUE: Bitcoin has independent momentum (leading)\n\n---\n\n**PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: 2024 Bitcoin ETF Approval**\n\n**Setup (October 2023 - January 2024):**\n\n**Macro Context:**\n- Fed still at 5.5% (restrictive)\n- Not cutting yet (first cut not until September 2024)\n- Stocks: Rallying but cautious\n- M2: Just turned positive (was negative all 2023)\n\n**Bitcoin Context:**\n- BlackRock files for Bitcoin ETF (June 2023)\n- 10+ other ETF applications filed\n- Market pricing in approval probability rising\n\n**The Divergence:**\n\n**October 2023:**\n- Bitcoin: $27k → $35k (+30% in October)\n- Nasdaq: 13,200 → 14,100 (+6.8%)\n- **Divergence: 23 percentage points**\n- Correlation: Dropped to 0.2 (normally 0.7)\n\n**November-December 2023:**\n- Bitcoin: $35k → $44k (+26%)\n- Nasdaq: 14,100 → 14,850 (+5.3%)\n- **Cumulative divergence: 50 percentage points over 2 months**\n\n**Stablecoin Supply:**\n- October-December 2023: +8% ($145B → $157B)\n- New capital entering crypto specifically\n\n**Volume Analysis:**\n- Bitcoin spot volume: Up 40% vs September\n- Stock market volume: Flat\n- Bitcoin volume leading\n\n**January 11, 2024: ETF Approved**\n- Bitcoin: Already at $46k (up 70% from October lows)\n- Much of move happened BEFORE approval (anticipation)\n- **Verdict: Bitcoin LED macro by pricing in crypto-specific catalyst 3 months early**\n\n---\n\n**WHEN TO TRUST LEADING SIGNALS:**\n\n**High Confidence (Bet on Bitcoin Leading):**\n\nIf ALL of these are true:\n1. ✓ Correlation < 0.3 for 4+ weeks\n2. ✓ Bitcoin outperforming by 20%+ over 30 days\n3. ✓ Clear crypto-specific catalyst (ETF, halving, major upgrade)\n4. ✓ Stablecoin supply rising (new capital)\n5. ✓ Institutional flows positive\n6. ✓ On-chain accumulation signals (exchange reserves falling)\n\n**Example**: Q4 2023 had all 6 = High confidence Bitcoin was leading\n\n**Low Confidence (Assume Bitcoin Still Following):**\n\nIf ANY of these are true:\n1. ✗ Correlation > 0.6 (still tied to macro)\n2. ✗ Divergence < 2 weeks (too short, could be noise)\n3. ✗ No clear crypto-specific catalyst\n4. ✗ Stablecoin supply flat/falling\n5. ✗ Bitcoin volume lower than stocks\n\n**Example**: Most of 2022 had multiple X's = Bitcoin was following macro down\n\n---\n\n**THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**\n\n**Leading ≠ Overriding**\n\n**Leading (Good):**\n- Bitcoin bottoms 2 weeks before stocks (both respond to same macro shift, Bitcoin is faster)\n- Bitcoin rallies on ETF anticipation 3 months before approval (crypto-specific catalyst)\n- Bitcoin prices in Fed pivot 6 weeks early (front-running macro)\n\n**Overriding (Rare, 1-in-15):**\n- Bitcoin rallies WHILE Fed is actively tightening (fighting macro headwinds)\n- Bitcoin sustains gains DESPITE deteriorating macro (2017 late-year parabola during Fed hikes)\n- Bitcoin decouples for 6+ months despite hostile macro (Cyprus 2013)\n\n**Leading is COMMON at turning points (10-15% of time)**\n**Overriding is RARE (5-7% of time, true paradigm shifts)**\n\n**Framework Guidance:**\n- When Bitcoin is LEADING: Add 0.5-1 point to framework score (early signal, favorable)\n- When Bitcoin is OVERRIDING: Add 1-2 points (paradigm shift, very favorable)\n- When Bitcoin is FOLLOWING: No adjustment (normal state, trust framework score)\n\n**Current State Check (Weekly):**\n\nEvery Sunday, ask:\n1. What was Bitcoin's 7-day return vs Nasdaq?\n2. What was the correlation this week?\n3. Were there crypto-specific events?\n4. Did Bitcoin move before or after macro news?\n\n**Answer → Determine state:**\n- Following (normal): Trust framework, outer circle dominates\n- Leading (turning point): Add 0.5-1 point, Bitcoin sensing shift early\n- Overriding (paradigm): Add 1-2 points temporarily, rare opportunity\n\nThis is how you detect the 5-15% of the time when Bitcoin isn't just following macro - it's either anticipating it (leading) or defying it (overriding).",

    "subtopic": "F.1 - The Nested Circle Framework",
    "question": "How do you integrate multiple timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) when reading the nested circles framework?",
    "answer": "The nested circles framework operates across multiple timeframes simultaneously - outer circles (macro) move on monthly/quarterly timeframes, middle circles (Bitcoin) on weekly/monthly, and inner circles (altcoins) on daily/weekly. Understanding how to integrate these different time horizons prevents whipsaws and improves timing. Here's the complete multi-timeframe system:\n\n**THE TIMEFRAME HIERARCHY:**\n\n**OUTER CIRCLE (MACRO) = MONTHLY/QUARTERLY TIMEFRAME**\n\n**Why Macro is Slow-Moving:**\n- Fed meets every 6 weeks (FOMC meetings)\n- M2 data released monthly\n- CPI/jobs data monthly\n- Policy changes take 3-12 months to flow through economy\n\n**Scoring Frequency:**\n- **Primary:** Monthly (first Sunday of each month)\n- **Secondary:** After major events (FOMC, CPI, jobs report)\n\n**Signal Persistence:**\nMacro signals are STICKY (last 3-12 months):\n- Fed hiking cycle: 12-18 months typically (2022-2023 was 18 months)\n- QE programs: 12-36 months (QE1, QE2, QE3 each lasted years)\n- Bear/bull markets: 12-24 months average\n\n**Action Timeframe:**\nWhen macro score changes by 1+ points:\n- React within 1-2 weeks (not hours or days)\n- Build/reduce positions over 2-4 weeks (scale in/out)\n- Don't rush - macro shifts are slow and sticky\n\n---\n\n**MIDDLE CIRCLE (BITCOIN) = WEEKLY/MONTHLY TIMEFRAME**\n\n**Why Bitcoin is Medium-Speed:**\n- Halving cycles: 4 years (but phases within cycle are 3-6 months)\n- On-chain trends: 2-8 weeks to establish\n- Valuation extremes: Develop over weeks/months\n- Institutional flows: Weekly data, trends over months\n\n**Scoring Frequency:**\n- **Primary:** Weekly (every Sunday)\n- **Secondary:** After Bitcoin 15%+ moves in a week\n\n**Signal Persistence:**\nBitcoin signals last weeks to months:\n- Cycle phases: 3-6 months each (accumulation, rally, distribution)\n- On-chain trends: 4-12 weeks typically\n- Valuation extremes: 2-6 months (MVRV elevated for months before top)\n\n**Action Timeframe:**\nWhen Bitcoin score changes by 1+ points:\n- React within 3-7 days\n- Adjust positions over 1-2 weeks\n- More urgent than macro, less urgent than altcoins\n\n---\n\n**INNER CIRCLE (ALTCOINS) = DAILY/WEEKLY TIMEFRAME**\n\n**Why Altcoins are Fast-Moving:**\n- Narratives emerge and die in weeks (AI hype, meme season)\n- BTC.D can swing 5% in 2-3 weeks\n- Sector rotation happens over days/weeks\n- Volatility: 10-30% weekly swings common\n\n**Scoring Frequency:**\n- **Primary:** Weekly (every Sunday)\n- **Secondary:** Daily monitoring if score > 9/12 (active altseason)\n\n**Signal Persistence:**\nAltcoin signals last days to weeks:\n- BTC.D trends: 2-8 weeks\n- Sector narratives: 3-12 weeks (some die faster)\n- Stablecoin supply changes: 2-6 weeks to play out\n\n**Action Timeframe:**\nWhen altcoin score changes by 1+ points:\n- React within 24-72 hours\n- Adjust altcoin positions within 1 week\n- Most time-sensitive circle (fastest to deteriorate)\n\n---\n\n**THE MULTI-TIMEFRAME INTEGRATION SYSTEM:**\n\n**RULE #1: Timeframe Alignment Requirement**\n\n**For maximum conviction, align ALL three timeframes:**\n\n**Monthly (Macro):**\n- Check: Is macro score improving or deteriorating over past 3 months?\n- Trend: Bullish (improving), Neutral (stable), Bearish (deteriorating)\n\n**Weekly (Bitcoin):**\n- Check: Is Bitcoin score improving or deteriorating over past 4 weeks?\n- Trend: Bullish, Neutral, Bearish\n\n**Daily (Altcoins, if applicable):**\n- Check: Is altcoin score improving or deteriorating over past 7 days?\n- Trend: Bullish, Neutral, Bearish\n\n**Alignment Matrix:**\n\n**MAXIMUM BULLISH (All Aligned Up):**\n- Monthly macro: Bullish trend (Fed easing, M2 rising)\n- Weekly Bitcoin: Bullish trend (cycle favorable, accumulation)\n- Daily altcoins: Bullish trend (BTC.D falling, sectors hot)\n- **Action**: Maximum position (80-100%), aggressive\n\n**MAXIMUM BEARISH (All Aligned Down):**\n- Monthly macro: Bearish trend (Fed tightening, M2 falling)\n- Weekly Bitcoin: Bearish trend (cycle late, distribution)\n- Daily altcoins: Bearish trend (BTC.D rising, sectors cold)\n- **Action**: Minimum position (0-10%), exit mode\n\n**MIXED SIGNALS (Timeframes Diverge):**\n- Monthly macro: Bullish, Weekly Bitcoin: Bearish, Daily alts: N/A\n- **Interpretation**: Macro supportive but Bitcoin not ready → Wait for Bitcoin to catch up\n- **Action**: 20-30% position, patient accumulation\n\nOR:\n\n- Monthly macro: Bearish, Weekly Bitcoin: Bullish, Daily alts: Bullish\n- **Interpretation**: Inner circles looking good but outer circle hostile → DANGER\n- **Action**: 10-20% position max, respect 93/7 rule (outer wins)\n\n---\n\n**RULE #2: Use Lower Timeframes for Entry, Higher Timeframes for Conviction**\n\n**Higher Timeframe (Monthly Macro) = CONVICTION**\n\nDetermines WHETHER to be bullish or bearish:\n- Macro bullish (3-4/4): Green light for crypto exposure\n- Macro neutral (2/4): Yellow light, selective\n- Macro bearish (0-1/4): Red light, exit or minimal\n\n**Medium Timeframe (Weekly Bitcoin) = POSITION SIZE**\n\nDetermines HOW MUCH to allocate:\n- Bitcoin score 3-4/4: Large position (60-80% of what macro allows)\n- Bitcoin score 2/4: Moderate position (40-50%)\n- Bitcoin score 0-1/4: Small position (10-20%)\n\n**Lower Timeframe (Daily Altcoins) = ALLOCATION**\n\nDetermines WHERE to allocate (Bitcoin vs alts, which sectors):\n- Altcoin score 3-4/4: 50-60% in alts, follow hot sectors\n- Altcoin score 1-2/4: 70-80% in Bitcoin, minimal alts\n- Altcoin score 0/4: 100% Bitcoin (or exit)\n\n**Example:**\n\n**Monthly Macro: 3/4 (Bullish - Fed cutting, M2 rising)**\n→ Conviction: BULLISH, crypto favorable\n\n**Weekly Bitcoin: 3.5/4 (Strong - pre-halving, accumulation, undervalued)**\n→ Position Size: 70% of capital in crypto\n\n**Daily Altcoins: 2/4 (Mixed - BTC.D stable, some sectors hot)**\n→ Allocation: 50% BTC, 20% alts (sector leaders), 30% stables\n\n**Total Position:**\n- Bitcoin: 35% of total capital\n- Altcoins: 14% of total capital  \n- Stables: 21%\n- Cash: 30%\n\n---\n\n**RULE #3: Timeframe Cascade (How Signals Flow)**\n\n**Top-Down Cascade (Normal Flow):**\n\n1. **Macro signal changes** (Fed pivots) → Takes 1-3 months to be clear\n2. **Bitcoin responds** 1-3 months after macro shift becomes clear\n3. **Altcoins respond** 1-3 months after Bitcoin confirms trend\n\n**Total lag: 3-9 months from macro shift to altcoin explosion**\n\n**Example - 2020 Bull Market:**\n- **March 2020**: Fed announces QE Infinity (macro shift)\n- **April-June 2020**: Bitcoin bottoms and starts recovery ($5k → $10k)\n- **July-September 2020**: Bitcoin confirms uptrend ($10k → $12k)\n- **October 2020**: Altcoins START to wake up (still lagging)\n- **November 2020 - May 2021**: Altseason (6 months after macro shift)\n\n**If you waited for altcoins to confirm, you entered at month 8-9. If you read macro shift at month 0-1 and positioned accordingly, you were 8 months early (massive edge).**\n\n**Bottom-Up Cascade (Early Warning):**\n\nRarely, signals can flow upward (inner → outer):\n\n1. **Altcoins die first** (capital flees to Bitcoin)\n2. **Bitcoin weakens** (capital flees to stables/fiat)\n3. **Macro confirms** (stocks crash, Fed forced to respond)\n\n**This is RISK-OFF cascade - inner circles are canaries in coal mine**\n\n**Example - May 2022:**\n- **May 2022**: LUNA collapse (inner circle crisis) → Altcoins crash -60-90%\n- **May-June 2022**: Bitcoin follows (-35% over 4 weeks)\n- **June 2022**: Stocks finally crash harder (SPX -20% in June)\n- Crypto signaled macro stress 2-4 weeks early\n\n---\n\n**PRACTICAL TIMEFRAME SCORECARD:**\n\n**Use this template every Sunday:**\n\n```\nMULTI-TIMEFRAME FRAMEWORK SCORE - Week of [DATE]\n\n=== MONTHLY (MACRO) ===\nCurrent Month: [Month]\nLast 3 Months Trend: [Improving/Stable/Deteriorating]\n\nMacro Score: __/4\n- Last month: __/4\n- 2 months ago: __/4  \n- 3 months ago: __/4\n- Trend: [↑ Bullish / → Neutral / ↓ Bearish]\n\nKey Events This Month:\n- Fed: [Action taken]\n- M2: [% change]\n- Major macro: [Event]\n\nCONVICTION: [Bullish/Neutral/Bearish]\n\n=== WEEKLY (BITCOIN) ===\nCurrent Week: Week of [Date]\nLast 4 Weeks Trend: [Improving/Stable/Deteriorating]\n\nBitcoin Score: __/4\n- This week: __/4\n- 1 week ago: __/4\n- 2 weeks ago: __/4\n- 3 weeks ago: __/4\n- 4 weeks ago: __/4\n- Trend: [↑ Bullish / → Neutral / ↓ Bearish]\n\nKey Changes This Week:\n- Price: $[XX]k (Δ: [+/- X]%)\n- On-chain: [Major change]\n- Valuation: [Level]\n\nPOSITION SIZE: [X]% of capital in crypto\n\n=== DAILY (ALTCOINS) ===\nLast 7 Days Trend: [Improving/Stable/Deteriorating]\n\nAltcoin Score: __/4 (if applicable)\n- Today: __/4\n- 3 days ago: __/4\n- 7 days ago: __/4\n- Trend: [↑ Bullish / → Neutral / ↓ Bearish]\n\nKey Changes This Week:\n- BTC.D: [XX]% (Δ: [+/- X]%)\n- Leading sector: [Sector]\n- Stablecoin supply: $[XX]B\n\nALLOCATION: [X]% BTC, [X]% alts, [X]% stables\n\n=== TIMEFRAME ALIGNMENT ===\nMonthly: [Bullish/Neutral/Bearish]\nWeekly: [Bullish/Neutral/Bearish]\nDaily: [Bullish/Neutral/Bearish]\n\nAlignment Status: [All Aligned / Mixed / Conflicting]\n\nACTION THIS WEEK: [Enter/Add/Hold/Reduce/Exit]\n```\n\n---\n\n**DECISION RULES BY TIMEFRAME ALIGNMENT:**\n\n**All 3 Aligned Bullish:**\n- Action: Aggressive accumulation\n- Urgency: High (move within 48 hours)\n- Position: 70-100% depending on total score\n\n**All 3 Aligned Bearish:**\n- Action: Exit or defensive\n- Urgency: EXTREME (move within 24 hours)\n- Position: 0-10% max\n\n**2 of 3 Bullish:**\n- Action: Moderate accumulation\n- Urgency: Medium (move within 1 week)\n- Position: 40-70%\n\n**2 of 3 Bearish:**\n- Action: Reduce exposure\n- Urgency: High (move within 2-3 days)\n- Position: 10-30%\n\n**1 of 3 Bullish (Divergence):**\n- Action: Minimal exposure, respect outer circle\n- Urgency: Low (no rush)\n- Position: 5-20%\n- **Remember 93/7 rule**: If outer circle bearish, don't bet on inner override\n\n---\n\n**REAL EXAMPLE: November 2024 Multi-Timeframe Analysis**\n\n**Monthly (Macro):**\n- Last 3 months: Improving (Fed cutting, M2 positive)\n- Current score: 2.9/4\n- Trend: ↑ Bullish (was 2.5/4 in August)\n- **Conviction: BULLISH**\n\n**Weekly (Bitcoin):**\n- Last 4 weeks: Deteriorating (rallied too fast, now extended)\n- Current score: 2.1/4 (valuation stretched)\n- Trend: ↓ Bearish (was 2.8/4 four weeks ago)\n- **Position Size: 20-30% (reduced from 40%)**\n\n**Daily (Altcoins):**\n- Prerequisites not met (Bitcoin < 3/4)\n- Altcoin score: N/A\n- **Allocation: 0% alts, 100% Bitcoin (if in crypto at all)**\n\n**Alignment:**\n- Monthly: Bullish\n- Weekly: Bearish  \n- Daily: N/A\n- **Status: CONFLICTING**\n\n**Interpretation:**\nMacro says \"be in crypto\" but Bitcoin says \"too extended, reduce exposure.\" This is a 2 of 3 mixed signal.\n\n**Action:**\nHold 20-30% position (down from 40% a month ago). Don't add here (Bitcoin extended). Don't exit entirely (macro supportive). Wait for:\n- Bitcoin pullback to $65-70k (buy signal), OR\n- Bitcoin breaks out >$95k with improving on-chain (chase signal), OR\n- Macro deteriorates (exit signal)\n\n**Position: 25% BTC, 0% alts, 75% stables**\n\nThis is how integrating multiple timeframes prevents chasing tops (daily FOMO) while respecting bigger trends (monthly macro bullish = don't go to 0%).",
